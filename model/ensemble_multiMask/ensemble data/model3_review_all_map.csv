0,Worked great until the bottom half of the screen went fuzzy and started blinking. We only bought it 3 months ago. We've only used it at home on the couch. Its never been dropped or taken anywhere.,2,4,5,4,5
1,Quick to start but slow on some more processor intense operations. Excellent value for the money I paid for it.,2,2,5,4,2
2,"So far so good. It came as advertised gtx 1050ti. Battery life is prettt bad. No gaming and light use, I was needing a charge after 2 hours. I paid for one day shipping and Amazon botched it. Seen it coming too,and questioned them on it,but they assured me it was on schedule. They took care of it of course.",2,0,3,2,2
3,Not what I expected. Slow even with 2 windows or tabs open. Battery life is not as long as noted. Maybe a good kids first pc but other than punching buttons it is too slow and freezes all the time.,3,2,5,4,6
4,"I spent a good amount of time searching for a decent laptop. I was stuck between a Mac and an ASUS, I ended up going with this laptop...obviously.I was looking for a laptop with a lot of memory, I'm becoming a coder so I needed plenty of space for my applications and programs. This laptop has it's pros and cons, just like anything else does. I'll start with pros: the look of it is very nice and sleek I must say, space, of course, is a big plus to me, I really just love ASUS as a whole honestly. Cons: the battery life isn't as spectacular as I would think it would be, the speakers are not that great, although I stream it through my tv so that doesn't really matter too much. Sometimes, it will randomly freeze, not too long but long enough.Overall I will say it's a good computer and I'm pleased with it. So depending on what you are looking for in terms of use, I would suggest this one if it would suit your needs.",1,2,1,2,3
5,So far a great laptop that more than exceeds what I need in a daily work computer. Plenty fast and reliable with no issues to date. Screen is great just wish that it would open to a larger angle. Keys and trackpad are among the best I have used in a windows laptop with perfect travel and response. Combined with the dock and an external monitor it really is a pleasure to work on.,0,2,3,2,4
6,False advertising! Comes with a dvd\rw that doesnt work because you have to buy the software to use the dvd player after you recieve it. Windows 10 does not support the dvd functions without buying the dvd app from Microsoft. I found this out by chatting with the Microsoft support tech. I'm betting all the other pc and laptops with Windows 10 are the same way. Sounds like a class action lawsuit to me.,2,2,1,2,2
7,"This item was not what I expected it was in bad shape and didn't charge the battery after I charge it for 2 hours it look very old and scratches all over, I'm very disappointed.",3,2,5,4,6
8,One of my favorite laptop's yet,2,2,4,4,2
9,"This laptop is a reasonable price but its still not worth it. I should have sent it back right from the start but thought I would hang in there with it. I am on a 400 mps wifi with a router that supports up to 600 and I am barely squeaking out 120 in the same room as the router. All other laptops (HP) have no issues reaching over 300. It is extremely slow and half the time will not process links even with pop up blocker off. Buy a better machine, I wish I did.",2,3,1,2,2
10,"Bought this as a second gaming pc for my daughter to play MMORPGs with me. Inexpensive, uncomplicated, and ready to go in an hour. Love it. No problems so far.",2,0,1,2,2
11,"The only reason I am giving it four stars and not five is because of the keyboard, which is okay but could be better. Otherwise, it is a great chromebook.",2,4,5,4,5
12,So far it is good,2,1,1,2,2
13,"Small, compact, beautiful color, quality materials for the exterior. It's just like my bigger asus. If you like asus you'll love this computer. It's got everything. At first I had a little trouble with the web browsing (maybe it was my internet) but it works great now. Great alternative if you want all the looks of a MacBook Air but not the price. Plus, it's got windows! How much better can it get. Now I can take a light and efficient (cause the battery is WOW) laptop to class with me. Great for turning in assignments and printing on the go!Update--- removed a star because it sometimes shuts off for no reason and you have to hold down the power button for legitimately 20 seconds for it to turn on again. I have mini heart attacks every time this happens.",3,1,5,4,3
14,"Good quality exept it has very horrible batterie life, mine only last about 3 hours",3,1,5,4,3
15,Awesome computer!,3,1,5,4,3
16,The laptop lasted under a month and one day it just died and didn't turn back on...,3,1,5,4,3
17,"The only reason the computer did not get 5 stars is because the picture and the description show a dark blue computer, but it is purple.",3,2,0,2,2
18,so far so good,3,1,2,4,2
19,Definitely enjoy. However the transfer of data from my other computer has been time consuming,2,2,0,2,2
20,"love this, sadly use it more than my MacBook pro.",2,4,5,4,5
21,Good modern product. Arrived in time.,3,2,2,0,3
22,"Only have it two stars, mostly for style, not even two months owning this laptop and already faced slow performance with the hard drive causing most of the slow down in performance, not to mention they use a cheap drive for this laptop, being that it's a gamer laptop you would think they would use a much better hard drive built for gaming rather than an ordinary hard drive, anyways was very disappointed with this laptop even with all the tweaks that I used to supposedly stop the 100% disk usage issue, did not fix the problem as the performance issue came back a couple days later, in the end I just returned it for a refund and will just order next time with the components I want in a gaming laptop, at least I'll get what I pay for next time",1,0,1,2,2
23,DOWNGRADED to 2 stars because of the supplied Operating System. Don't buy unless you're willing to format. The Win 10-Home that comes with it is USELESS. I'm losing many hours of work because the unmanageable updates are constantly breaking my programs. The audio pops all the time and the video on my HDMI began to spaz out after one of these unrequested updates.UPDATE: upgraded to Win 10 per ASUS support suggestion and it has solved NOTHING !! It's fast but all the quirks will drive you crazy. Go find a Toshiba or Lenovo.UPDATE: ASUS support completely clueless. Tells me to format. They have no real 2nd tier knowledge to solve problems. They just e-mail people telling them to format.,1,2,1,2,3
24,"More than what I expected. My last Dell didnt last long but I did get it at Walmart. This computer is beatiful, easy to work through, even with the new Windows, and it has handled every program and game I have played on it. Worth the money.",1,0,1,2,2
25,"I love this laptop, functions great, great price. Thank you HP for such a high quality laptop",2,2,1,1,1
26,"Perhaps it's because I'm middle aged and slowing down myself but I don't understand how anyone can think this is a slow computer. It's not the fastest I've owned but an i3 priced in the $350 range isn't going to run with the $700 machines. I plan to use this one for data storage and access, not as my main machine. To that end, setting up a simple database and retrieving information, online data searches, e-mail, and blog posting (pictures, text -- running on Wordpress) has so far been a breeze and this E15 is more than fast enough, has plenty of storage, and a very good set of ports including VGA. The CD/DVD drive works perfectly and is a nice addition, as my other relatively new laptop did not include one. Windows 10 is pre-installed as are the usual bloatware, easily uninstalled. Speakers actually sound pretty good, though I'm a headphones guy and would never judge a laptop by its sound system.Battery life is exceptional, making this an ideal travel machine.Two issues. 1) This is not a genuinely dual channel setup. This is 4 GB + 2GB (a kind of 'flex' processing) and while this likely won't matter to many budget customers, as the speed will be plenty fast, I think claiming dual channel is a bit misleading. It is faster than a single channel of 6 GB. OK, I'm being a little picky. 2) The screen isn't the best. It looks a bit dull, frankly, kind of like the old TFT screens found on all those old Toshiba laptops from years ago. If you're trying to save money on a laptop but still need deep, clear, saturated color, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.For the price, this E 15 is a very competitive machine. It's fast enough and has enough storage, ports, a dedicated number pad, and a responsive enough touch pad that I'm finding it very easy to use. (Using two-fingered commands on the pad is especially good on this machine.) Were it to have backlit keys and a better screen, it would be a stellar laptop for all my needs and would likely make it to my office as my main machine. As it is, it's a great backup and would be the perfect student computer as long as graphics aren't terribly important. Heck, it even looks great.This is my first Acer but it likely won't be my last.",2,2,1,3,2
27,"If you have read some other reviews, you may have noticed the gripe about there being 10 gigs left after what it came with. Truth! Plus, it wants to update right away. So if you are buying this for just light use or for the kiddos, do yourself a favor and buy a good sized SD card to add some space because if you want to download anything that is going to use space, you will run out quickly. You're almost better off opting for a computer with more hard drive space if you don't want to mess with that. You can get rid of a few apps, but you aren't going to recover much space. I do feel that that it should be clear that you are only going to have 10 Gigs, in reality since so much of it is taken up by other processes.The update was slow. The computer is slow, so the update took a long time. Like hours. Windows 10? It ran slow too. Basically most functions ran slow. This is the turtle in a race against the rabbits you can buy out there. If you are accustomed to a fast running computer, this is not the model for you. If you just want to do some basic things on it (no gaming for sure), then it's probably OK for your needs.The computer did well with web browsing and played Netflix just fine. The charger is small and light as well and that's also a plus for traveling.But, it was super light --- which made it great for flying with. The battery life was pretty good for flying also.",3,4,5,4,3
28,"Very good, works well, is fast",2,2,1,3,2
29,"Please read the product description. There is absolutely NO memory on the computer. I downloaded google chrome, kindle and one other app and that was all the space available. Speakers were good but that was its only redeemable quality.",3,1,5,4,3
30,These five Acer Flagship CB3-532 HD Chromebooks are working beautifully in my Aquatic Science classroom. They are helping my students do research; post to Schoology; write essays and so much more.,2,2,5,4,2
31,Refurbished laptop works excellently and if you can handle there being a couple of scratches that do not in any way impact the performance of the computer this is the perfect product!,2,2,5,4,3
32,"I absolutely love this product. It is light, and ideal for traveling with. Has a SSD with more than adequate storage for my needs, more than enough RAM, more than enough CPU speed/performance for everything I do. Battery life is ~ 7h. The network connectivity chip of this PC is a welcome change from my last PC (an HP which struggled with connecting to Wifi). This laptop immediately locks in to the nearest WiFi extender in my home - or any other WiFi I connect it to. LOVE the back-lit keyboard (my MUST-HAVE feature). Just the perfect PC for me. Very happy - No hesitation recommending this product.",1,2,3,2,4
33,All the specs are there! Awesome laptop!,2,0,3,2,2
34,nice product and useful for my kids for their activities,2,2,0,2,2
35,"Being new into computer gaming reviews are accurate. Runs smooth, and haven't had any issues with games. Battery life sucks, and the fan gets loud, but with my setup it doesn't hinder anything and if I needed something mobile i'll pick up my Switch. Very good buy for the price!",2,0,1,0,2
36,Great computer from my grandkids.,3,4,5,4,3
37,Worked well right out of the box,2,2,5,4,2
38,No problems,3,4,5,5,6
39,Good laptop but the charging cord is trash. I breaks within 2 months if you do anything except use it as a desktop machine. Dell's warranty is not worth the paper it is printed on and will not be honored. I cannot recommend spending 700 for a laptop then having to spend an additional 40 every 2 months on new charging cords. Any type of frequent movement (ie adjusting how you are sitting while reading in bed on the laptop) causes the power cord to separate from the plug that goes into the computer.UPDATE: The day after posting this review I received a call from a higher up in dell customer service. They upheld the warranty and sent a new cord. When I received the new cord it was obvious that the original cord was defective from the beginning which could happen with any product. Other then the cord issue it is a good reasonably priced gaming laptop.,1,0,1,2,2
40,I love it!,2,4,5,4,3
41,"Disappointed to find that this product was used, box had been open and it had scuff marks on it. Understand that its a good price but it doesnt say anything in the description about the item being a return or used. BUYER BEWARE",1,2,3,2,4
42,Great laptop. Not a single issue. Upgraded wifi card cost $30ish otherwise havent changed a thing.,2,1,1,2,2
43,"Great product, more than I expected.",2,2,1,3,1
44,"I purchased a new Asus UX430UAR. Set up and immediately experienced blurry text in some programs. I contacted ASUS customer support and spent 2 days going back n forth with them. They identified that my computer did not have Splendid, Eye Care, Tru2life Video and Audio Wizard software. Upon installing drivers I received the ""Missing ICM file"" when Splendid was installing. Customer service had me reset my computer back to factory and I still received the error. They recommended that I send it back to seller (Amazon). I received my new laptop and once set up with all current updates, still no Splendid, Eye Care, Tru2life or Audio wizard!! Went through installing all the drivers again, received the same error ""Missing ICM file"". Very frustrated that 2 computers both have the same problem with no fix from ASUS.",3,2,2,0,3
45,"In 2018, GTX 1050 is little not buy-worthy but for this budget, this is the best. Thin and awesome design. Fans are little loud when the gpu at max.Played far cry 5 High quality (not ultra) without a single problem except the fans are louder than expected. That is not a big problem if you use a headphone",2,0,1,0,2
46,"It looks great but i could never finish upgrading the system as soon as I got it. It was the slowest machine I have never had, and my last one was a dell machine I bought on 2008. It took to long to turn on by a 2018 standard. The battery was at 43 percent after fully charged after 1 and 1/5 time of looking it up. Disappointed I returned it right away.",3,2,1,2,2
47,"This computer is advertised as having a ""quad core"" processor which would seem to imply that at a minimum it is not slow. My experience with this machine for a few months now can best be summed up in one word, ""disappointed"". This computer is so slow that when using Microsoft Word, Edge, or Outlook, the screen display cannot even keep up with my slow typing. It lags at least a word behind. Very awkward. In addition it is incapable of going more than one level deep into any web site. If there are pages with photos to look through it simply stops and freezes. It has been OK for the purpose I intended which is reading my Kindle books using your Kindle for PC software, although it often takes more that a minute for the program to open. I would not recommend this computer to anyone who has even average speed requirements.",3,1,5,4,3
48,"Computer arrived new in original packaging, when turned on it had a pink horizontal line all the way across the screen. Had to return. Amazon refunded my money and I ordered another computer.",2,2,1,2,1
49,I've owned Asus computers and mother boards for a long time and they have always met my expectations.Their support is good and the forums are helpful. This P-Series is fast and the screen is sharp.,2,2,1,2,2
50,"Great PC, did everything I needed for school. I had to return it because it did not have the correct version of Windows. It claimed to have windows 10 pro, but in fact had a non-genuine copy of windows enterprise.",3,2,5,4,6
51,"Very pleased with this purchase, I got it mostly for my wife to work on her spreadsheets and scheduling for work remotely that being said it runs silently while doing that and the battery life is pretty good.I myself am a gamer and wanted something to be able to play games when away from my desktop we brought it on a trip and I was surprisingly able to play far cry 5 on ultra settings at 1080p while keeping a stable frame rate of 40 to 55 FPS which for a laptop with an i5 and a 1060 max q was awesome though the only downside is. that you have to keep it plugged in and the fans can be a bit noisy but I play with headphones so it wasnt a bother at all I would recommend this laptop to anyone at this price point.",1,0,5,2,2
52,"Very great affordable gaming laptop. The specs dont lie. For the price of this laptop, its hard to get much more than what this laptop provides, I have yet to run into a game it cant play and its remarkably fast and is also fashionable",1,0,1,2,2
53,"Battery dies fast, but in other aspects this laptop is 10/10!",2,0,1,2,2
54,Excellent !!....,2,2,1,2,2
55,"Update: see the original review belowIt's been a year and I'm finally out of space which is fine because I can buy more storage (ie. Micro SD Card) if you're unsure about buying a mostly cloud based laptop go for it but know that you're not doing for space. I would definitely purchase this again and stand by my five star review.*****I didn't want to review it til I was sure and I'm certain this computer is legit. It's lightweight, affordable, and pretty to look at. I even found a matching wireless mouse. I've had this laptop for a little over a month and I enjoy how fast it is. I use it for word processing mostly and blogging. The fact that you can also add your own storage with a micro SD Card is also a big win. I'm thinking of purchasing an external hard drive for more storage. I haven't run into any cons so far. I can watch videos, write, and not worry about any lag. It's so light that you can carry i t with one hand. The color isn't a shiny gold and I don't care. I would recommend this for anyone that's on the fence about purchasing this.",3,1,5,4,3
56,Great Product,1,2,3,2,4
57,"Really small, which i love. Light weight which is amazing.Its a bit slower than i expected, but its good for what i need it",3,1,5,4,3
58,Could possibly be returning it. I'm sure the product itself is great but it arrived in an extremely damaged and oversized box so the device had clearly been slamming around in there the whole way to my house and I think that directly relates to the fact that at least 5 times per day since I got it(which was less than 7 days ago) it has frozen to the point where not even the power button works and I have to do a hard reboot to get it to work again. Really annoying when I'm in the middle of note taking on it at school. I really don't want to return it but I feel like I have to... I may give it a few more days but I should of said something to amazon as soon as I got it. I ordered it just in time for school though and I don't wanna be stuck without it now that all my class docs are on it...,2,4,5,4,5

62,Great computer for the money! I love the keyboard - my fingers fly on it!,3,1,5,4,3
63,Great purchase!,2,2,5,4,2
64,Absolutely love my new laptop. Have always wanted one with a backlit keyboard. This thing is super fast too!,2,2,0,2,1
65,Fast. Works great!!,2,2,1,4,2
66,"I agree that the keyboard could be better. It's not 'bad' or 'awful'. It doesn't have a lot of travel and the keys do feel a bit 'cheap'.However, if you type a lot you'll have no problems at all.The machine is light, very attractive and thin.It's responsive and quick.I cannot speak to battery life as I've not run it flat yet.This machine is replacing an Acer C720 and I'm extremely pleased with it.Obviously with Chromebooks setting up is extremely simple.Running Android apps on the Samsung Chromebook Plus is very good. I realise there are some mixed experiences as some apps don't scale to the screen well. So far that's not been my experience. I guess it depends on the apps you're using.The screen is fantastic and the sound if very good. Given the limitations I'm quite happy with the volume. I don't expect bass on these devices so if you want a stronger bass, buy external speakers that have this capacity - you can't expect miracles.",2,4,5,4,5
67,"I recently purchased the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro. I initially thought I would like the Pro better because it is faster. However, if you use the Stylus much - such as in Squid you will find that the PLUS has noticeably less lag than the Pro. Apparently there is some optimizations that Google has done with the OP1 and Pixel that allow what is called Instant Ink.So if you want instant ink stylus response the Plus is better than the Pro.I have also noticed the Pro seems to run hotter and have a noticeably shorter battery life.I will be sending back my Chromebook Pro and keeping the Chromebook Plus. To me the Plus is fast enough, has better battery life, runs cooler and if you take notes in Squid it is noticeably more responsive.",2,4,5,4,5
68,"The performance and built quality is amazing. The laptop boots up extremely fast and plenty of RAM really helps if you into coding or data science.There's just one issue that many other DELL users have also mentioned. Certain applications like VLC, Codeblocks get pixellated despite the laptop supporting that level of graphics. Maybe there are some display compatibility issues.Overall, this laptop is an extremely good option in this price.",1,0,1,2,2
69,"So, first thing is first: I am not a heavy PC gamer. I play mostly consoles when I do game. But I needed a new laptop for school and music production and it's rare to find a laptop with an actual graphics card higher than a 960M for this price.A few points:This DID come with 8GB DDR4 RAM, a 4GB GTX 1050 (not the Ti edition), and a 1TB hard drive. It does support up to 32GB RAM using 2 16GB sticks, and is upgradeable through a door on the bottom.Pros:-This laptop feels sturdy and solid. I love the red accents and the solid black main body color.-The graphics card has handled the light gaming I've done with it with flying colors. So far, I've tested Portal 2 at maxed out settings and it's done roughly 180-200fps. LA Noire at all maxed settings keeps a steady 30fps (it's frame locked), Metro 2033 at maxed settings runs at roughly 45fps.-The Intel i5 has been a solid CPU for it as well.-The wifi uses ac and b/g/n so it makes full usage of the 5ghz channel for wireless. The speed difference is night and day. I get almost triple the download speed using ac over b/g/n.-Battery life unplugged and surfing the internet is really good. 7-8 hours.Cons:-Ok, so this is my major issue and the only reason it's not getting 5 stars. The speakers are...not great. They advertise a subwoofer, but I'm not sure what the deal with that is since the bass on this is average at best. The speakers do tend to crackle and distort at higher volumes to the point where a musician like myself gets very annoyed. I'm actually debating on buying a bluetooth speaker to use instead.Overall, if you're looking for a solid gaming laptop, this is probably the best one I've found, but be aware that the speakers are not great and I almost feel like they dropped sound quality to increase graphics quality. It's a weird trade.",1,0,1,2,2
70,"Dont get me wrong: this laptop is light years ahead of any computer I have ever owned. It is slim, light, fast, great looking I really wanted one that had an SSD and hard drive so I could work quickly but store a lot of photographs and at work. But for streaming video it is terrible  the sound is very quiet and very muffled. I dont want to have to get external speakers or wear headphones every time I want to watch a show. Havent decided if Im going to return it but Im very disappointed.",1,2,1,2,3
71,"This is a crummy computer. As soon as I started it up and began setting it up, it said it needed to do a major update for windows 10, and it would take hours. Three hours later it said it couldn't load the updates because there were corrupted files. I get my internet through satellite and pay $95 month, and this piece of crap used 1/4 my monthly allowance. Then it tried again and failed, another $25 worth of download time wasted. This was all happening in the background, and suddenly I realized I had been throttled back by my satellite company and had to buy additional time just to stay online. That cost me another $50, and this crap machine kept burning it up. So I went in and disabled the Win10 update app. Next time I turned it off and back on it went into a loop, you guessed it, trying to install updates, failed shutting down, then trying to install updates, failed, then shutting down. Non stop never booted up again. Try calling the ACER help line and you will get someone who can barely speak English. I called 4 times and had to hang up because there was no one capable of speaking clearly. Horrible computer from a crummy company that hires idiots who can't even speak the language, DONT BUY I returned mine and will never buy an ACER product again.",2,4,1,2,2
72,"Exactly what I needed. I use a laptop for online work and my last one died on me. This is my first chromebook. I had went out and bought an 11 inch Chromebook from the store, came home and was disappointed by the screen size. Returned it and started looking on Amazon. Found this one for the same price as the 11 inch one so I was thrilled. I knew I needed a bigger screen. It seriously looks brand new and was packaged very well. Very fast for surfing which is basically all I need it for. My daughter likes to play online games on it as well. Super happy with it so far.",2,2,5,4,2
73,Absolutely love the laptop. I have had no problems with it. Definitely would buy an Asus again.,3,1,5,4,3

75,I was very disappointed that it was not the laptop shown on the description.,2,2,5,4,3
76,"One of the first things I did when I got this computer is replace the hard drive with an SSD. This was actually pretty painless to do. From there, I just reinstalled Windows.I bought this computer mainly for the processor. Since one of the other reviewers noted that their computer came with an i3, and I was buying this purely because it came with an i5, that's the first thing I checked. To my surprise, the processor in my computer was slightly better than the one advertised. My computer came with an i5 3340 (2.7/3.4ghz) which is better than the 3320m it was supposed to come with (2.6/3.2ghz). I intend on using this computer for programming so I installed Visual Studio, SSMS, etc. With the SSD they all load within a few seconds, and I'm fairly happy with the performance.As I'm writing this review, I'm pretty happy with the keyboard. This was a business class laptop, and you can definitely tell from the construction. It feels pretty solid.There are some cons to take into consideration however:The maximum resolution on the display is 1376 x 768. My old laptop, which I'm going to be replacing with this one, was 1920 x 1080. So it's a bit disappointing that I'm going to be losing some screen real estate. I intend on having the programs open with the ebooks next to them. So the screen resolution will make it harder to have them side-by-side. In addition to the resolution, the screen is not touch screen.I was having an issue connecting to my wifi for some reason. The issue was fixed when I reinstalled Windows on the SSD. I'm not sure if it was due to using the SSD or due to reinstalling Windows. But whatever the case may be, that fixed the issue.The battery life on the computer looks like its a maximum of two hours. On my previous laptop it was 5 hours. So something like this is a bit disappointing, especially from a computer that's supposed to be a business class laptop. You may have to replace the battery with another one online if you hope to have a decent battery life.As someone from an accounting background, the lack of a ten-key is disappointing.Lastly, the computer ships with 32-bit Windows. While this probably won't be an issue for most people, it does prevent you from using all of the ram that the computer ships with. And, for someone like me, it may also limit performance.Overall, I'm fairly happy with this computer. I bought this mainly for processing power and I sure got it. However, depending on what your needs are, this may not be the computer for you. But I think it'd be hard to go wrong with this computer. A review from PCMag from around 4 years ago notes that this computer sold for around $830. So you're getting quite a good value paying significantly less than that.",2,2,3,4,3

Graphics could be faster... but not for this price tag! I love Windows 10, and particularly the fact it is not Windows 8...The only but I find it that when plugged it generates that weird electric field around the keyboard and behind the screen that you feel when you pass your finger or hand.

The battery life: 6-7 hours if I'm multitasking--not the worst ever, and at least the battery is consistent4. Android apps: Kindle, Amazon, Drive, Photos, Snapseed, Gmail, Hangouts, Keep, Google Calendar, OneDrive5. Security: password locked on boot-up, smart-lock if my cell phone is close by6. Keyboard: deep travel, large keysWhat I hate:1. No Microsoft Office apps anymore (as of 24 Mar 2017). I had to sideload the apks from my smartphone. They installed and worked great. I think Microsoft is just the punk as usual and revoked their access to Chromebooks.2. My favorite game on android (Rusted Warfare) will not accept touch input after I join an online game.3. The battery life is not 10+ hrs4. Slower charging for a full charge. It takes at least a couple hours for a full charge.5. No multitasking in tablet mode6. No desktop icons7. Swiping gestures in android apps are buggy. Sometimes it recognizes the swipe and sometimes not.8. KineMaster (the best professional video editing app for Android) force quits every time I try to launch it.9. Will not read 1080p 60fps video properly from my SD card from my camera. It opens the video and plays a weird rainbow filtered version of my video. It is by no means useful.Since there are so many negatives... I may be returning this Chromebook.",2,4,5,4,5

100,"This is my first significant product review, but after spending a week with the device I thought I would offer my thoughts. I bought it mainly as a light cheap, beater device to do web browsing, minor productivity, and wanted stylus specifically for MS OneNoteTLDR: Great value for inking and minor productivity if bought refurbished. Pros: Light, good screen, tolerable keyboard, all day battery life on low brightness settings (8-10hrs), stylus is good in OneNote Cons: No USBA ports, As of 6/24/17, NO NATIVE MICROSOFT OFFICE SUPPORT from playstore (see below). Must be sideloaded in developer mode. Freezes/slows at >8-9 tabs in chrome.Hardware:Build: All aluminum, initial impression is good, though torx screws on bottom of device get loose quicklyI/O: 2x usbc ports allows charging from either side, headphone jack works fineKeyboard/Trackpad: Keyboard is mushy but tolerable. No backlight. Major complaint is small backspace key, but I have gotten used to it pretty quickly. Trackpad generally works.Screen: Stellar and bright enough to use outsideSpeakers: Downfiring, generally OK but not greatPerformance: Has generally been fine when working exclusively in chrome. My unit does tend to freeze/slow down when I have more than 9ish tabs open in chrome in addition to a couple of apps like slack and onenote so this is not a device for heavy multitaskers.Software:ChromeOS: Works fine. After some tweaks, I WAS able to connect it to enterprise WPA, though with some difficulty.Play Store: Works great! As of 6/24/17 you can only adjust app window sizes to full screen half screen or minimized, but it was fine for my use with one major caveat.As of 6/24/17, does NOT natively support MIcrosoft Office. OneNote, Word, Excel play store apps must be sideloaded in developer mode. Microsoft has arbitrarily decided that it will not support Android Microsoft apps on any device >10"" in size. This is very unfortunate as I bought this specifically to use it for OneNote and as far as I can tell, OneNote offers the smoothest inking experience on this device. Squid works pretty well too.Conclusion:It takes some work, but this functions well as secondary lightweight device for MS onenote and light productivity on enterprise networks. However, it take quite a bit of googling to figure out how to sideload microsoft office.Other tips:-When I first received my refurbished unit, it would not power on and the LED indicator was flashing blue, red, and white. I'm not sure what state this indicates, but if you powerwash the device (Esc+Refresh+power button) and plug the device in, the LED will turn solid red and the device will charge. After fully charging it (about 4 hours), you will be able to power on the device normally.-Ubuntu on this device seems to be doable, but the drivers are not perfect....yet",2,4,5,4,5

111,"My review will cover pros and cons to help others determine whether given the brand and retail price point of $450, this is a worthy purchase. Note I bought the Samsung CB+ device for $350.Cons:*Overall: A bit shocked by the issues noted below given the notoriety of the Samsung and Google brands and the pricing of the CB+. At $450 I would say the device is not worth the price, but since I got it for $350, I'm on the fence about keeping it. I suppose at $350 or less I'm willing to tolerate these nuisances given the pros.1. Trackpad Sensitivity is Weak - My prior laptop was a MacBook Air which had a superior trackpad, so perhaps this is what you get for $450. I find it slow to react to a light touch, especially if you are one who relies on tapping versus clicking. You can increase the speed of the cursor, but you can't increase the sensitivity of the actual trackpad to react to being touching lightly or hard. I imagine this inferior trackpad is due to this device also being touchscreen - can't complain if you can just touch the screen.**update - determined the trackpad has a bit of a ""dead zone"" around the left and right edges. Doesn't respond to touch until about 0.5 to 1 inch in from the left and right.2. Caps Lock Button Missing - There is no caps lock button. There is a Google Search button in it's place. You must use the shortcut Alt+Search to enable caps lock and hit Shift to turn it off. This significantly slows down typing for me and am having difficulty retraining my brain not to hit the Search button. Typing this review I've hit it at least 10 times already accidentally. Seems silly to get rid of caps lock given this is how every keyboard is configured. It's like swapping the q and m buttons. There are volume buttons at the top of the keyboard and on the side of the device with the power button. Instead of having 2 sets of volume buttons, they could have kept caps lock and moved the search button to the space at the top occupied by the second set of volume buttons.3. Unlock is Inconsistent - Your options are to unlock with Google password, Smartlock via your phone Bluetooth, or a Pin. Your options to login are your Google Password or Smartlock. I find that even coming from unlock (not login) the CB+ doesn't always present the option to enter a Pin. I'd say I'm probably given the option to enter my Pin 50% of the time. On top of that, it takes several minutes before it finds my phone, even when BT is enabled and the phone on top of the CB+. Sometimes it doesn't find the phone at all. If you have a complex Google password be prepared to login to your password manager to retrieve it every time you want to login to your CB+.4. Extensions Slow Down Browsing - I only have 3 extensions and have noticed significant slow down in pages loading which I never experienced on the MacBook Air.5. Apps Not Optimized for CB+ - I find that many apps don't seem quite compatible with this device. For example, VPN extension works great while the same VPN app does nothing.6. Adobe Flash - Occasionally encounter issues with Flash sites not loading that I've never had before on other devices.7. Backspace Next to Lock Button - The backspace button is very short and is directly under the lock button. This is poor placement of a button that will lock your computer to place it next to a commonly used button. I've accidentally locked my CB+ when trying to backspace.8. CB+ Hard Case - Samsung does not offer a hard case accessory for this device. The hard case by iPearl sold on Amazon prevents the device from fully folding into tablet mode.9. Speakers Weak - You probably need an external Bluetooth speaker if not casting to a TV.10. Random Issues - Certain tabs will go fully black with bands of white through it. Randomly had the whole screen freeze for several minutes. Closed and re-opened screen twice until it appeared to re-boot. Again CB+ did not find phone via Bluetooth to utilize Smartlock and proceeded to indicate Bluetooth was turned off. Upon finally logging back in, I confirmed Bluetooth was on the whole time.Pros:*Overall - I love the versatility of the device being reversible, touchscreen, and the built-in pen. Given I primarily need a device for internet browsing and casting videos, this meets my needs.1. Reversible - Easily convert from laptop to a tablet. Use the keyboard to prop it on a table in a shape like this: ^ or this: _\.2. Touchscreen - Easily navigate between apps, chrome tabs, etc. with touchscreen in laptop or tablet config.3. Pen - Create screenshots or hand written notes/drawings with the pen.4. Apps/Extensions - Choose between installing Google Play apps, using Chrome Web store extensions, or links to regular web apps.5. Cloud - Store and sync your notes, documents, pictures, etc to Google Drive and access it from your other devices.6. Chromecast - Cast tabs and videos with your Google Chromecast using extension or Google Home app.7. Swype - Touchscreen keyboard already enable to recognize Swype entry.",2,4,5,4,5

114,"Eight months in, little laptop pleases. This isn't to say it doesn't have it's quirks. Let me get negatives out of the way. Firstly, the touchpad will randomly fail. This can be corrected with a simple reset. One other issue is the WIFI card losing its ability recognize wireless networks. This is also an easy fix. These really are the only drawbacks. They always occur when returning from sleep mode and wouldn't discourage me from buying this laptop again were I in the market. Other minor flaws: The very low volume of this computer's speakers. You're going to want to plug in some headphones even with negligible environmental noise. Also, the storage on this thing is tiny. After eight months of use I have still not filled it. Of course, I am almost exclusively storing text files. You could seriously remedy this with an SD card (for which this has a slot) or a USB thumb drive.Now I'll briefly go over the notable positives of this computer. The battery life, though gradually waning, is great. In the first six months this thing could go for 2-4 days of consistent use without a charge. Eight months later, it needs to be plugged in every 1-3 days. Keep in mind, I constantly use this laptop for writing and surfing the internet. The screen is great. It's nice for watching videos. It's easy on the eyes if you're word processing. They keyboard feels nice and is a pleasure for typing. It's also a nice looking little laptop. The WIFI card works very well and gets a better signal than my more expensive ASUS laptop.In summation, this would be a perfect laptop for writers.

Once the battery starts to go, you can't replace it. Unless you can take apart the entire laptop and replace the battery cells yourself, you would have to purchase another one.Not sure how universal this issue is but the speakers on mine are looow compared to other similar laptops from other manufacturers so be wary of that.",2,2,1,3,2

129,"I decided to buy another HP to replace my current HP. When I started looking for a computer I was looking at metal chassis machines for durability. I travel a lot and use my computer on planes, trains, in coffee shops, malls, and sometimes in my office. I have had my current HP for 7 years and it has always performed nicely. I bought a Lenovo 3 years ago as a replacement because my HP was starting to slow down and I am impatient. The screen developed a line across it just after a year. Multiple screws fell out of the case and it started getting buggy. I switched back to my HP and it performed without any problems. The more I researched the more I went back to HP.When I received the package the outer box was undamaged but the original box the computer was packed in had significant damage and my first thought was I had to return it. The second thought was why would they ship a computer in a box with that much damage. I took pictures and prepared to return the computer. I travel a lot for work and do not spend much time in the United States and the next time I will be in the country is in June of 2018 so I thought if the computer works and is not damaged I will keep it. I took the computer out of the packaging and there were no visible signs of damage. I plugged it in and started it up and everything worked just like it should. Everything is tight with no scratches.The computer is light and looks like it has a metal chassis. It feels solid and not flimsy like some other brands. About 2 hours after I finished setting it up I stepped outside for a minute and my granddaughter pulled the computer off the table onto the hardwood floor. She did not get hit with the computer and my wife quickly moved her to another room and picked up my computer. She was afraid it was broken. After looking the computer over the only damage is to one of the corners. The computer is still solid, and works just fine. I am very happy with it and will look at HP again next time I buy a computer.I timed the battery life and with normal use with no gaming and only light video streaming it lasted more than 8 hours. I expect the time to go down some over time but if I get half the performance I got out of my old HP I expect the battery to last during most of my out of office time and during all but the longest flights.I only gave 4 stars because the damage done to the box. There were three items in the Amazon box when it arrived and this one was in the middle so it was not damaged in transit. It had to be damaged prior to shipping.",2,2,1,2,3

My ""main"" laptop is big and powerful, yet quite heavy and bulky.

Being $200, I didn't expect TOO much out of it, but I was surprised. It is very light. powerful, sturdy, and has a long battery life. I have run into zero problems with this laptop so far and have no complaints. I downloaded Java and two IDEs and ran a test program. Also, the game League of Legends actually runs on this thing! However, the settings need to be tuned to lower the visual quality.I highly recommend this laptop. You get more than what you pay for, and I honestly haven't seen another laptop that competes with this one very well.

I have also noticed that Yahoo doesn't operate very quickly or efficient with this unit which isn't a big deal either. The only thing that I'm truly disappointed in so far is the color, this unit was suppose to be blue according to the description but instead it's a very purple unit.

157,"ASUS E200HA-UB02-GD Portable 11.6-Inch Intel Quad-Core Laptop 4GB RAM 32GB Storage, Windows 10, Aurora Gold.- The Chromebook competitor from ASUS is a winner. For under $200, ASUS has created a fairly powerful serious Windows 10 computer. My present workhorse laptop is a Lenovo Ultrabook IdeaPad Yoga 13 with an Intel I-5 chip (1.8 ghz) and this review will compare the two - the Asus is obviously smaller (by about 4 inches screen size) and less than half the weight - so its advantage is obviously where small size and weight is preferable to a bigger screen/keyboard/etc. My Lenovo runs Win 8.1 and the ASUS uses Win 10. I use Classic Shell on both (get it - it's free and lets you customize Win 8 or 10 to resemble XP or Win 7 menus). One note right away - most sellers sell the ASUS with just 2 GB, so stick to Amazon that has 4GB (I think that's really needed to power today's computers at a minimum). Now here's how the ASUS has done:I tried the ASUS with 4 web browsers (hate Edge, but IE11 is buried in there and can be used, and I also loaded Firefox and Chrome which run fine). I'm not a BING fan but switching search engines to Google isn't hard and I recommend that. I tried my old MSN mail dialup program (which is the old paid version of Hotmail) and it, along with Outlook, both did fine with Microsoft based mail. The ASUS came with a free year of Office 365 and that worked fine - I prefer the older versions of Word, etc., but a free year makes this $199 computer an even bigger bargain. I was also able to download my Corel Word Perfect/Office (Version 7) and it ran well too. I was able to open quite a few programs (all of the above) at once, with a total of about 15 separate browser windows open along with the mail and both word processors and the computer handled that. Web surfing and page loading was about as fast on the ASUS as on my Lenovo, a surprise, since the Lenovo is an i5 and the ASUS is a slower Atom chip, albeit a quad-core version. My gut says the ASUS will do fine for those who mainly web surf and do mail and word processing, but serious gamers will not have the power they need. But for a student or office work, this computer is a BARGAIN, and with it selling at a Chromebook price, it's an amazing deal.Two tips: While the touchpad was fine, I like mice, and a wireless mouse was a good addition. Also the computer is very limited on memory (32 GB, of which Windows and Office use much of that), so spend a few bucks and add a 128 GB microSD card (I did) and download files and less used programs there. There is a slot for the card.Plusses: It has a USB3 port and USB2 port, plus an HDMI port and speaker jack. It has a very good responsive keyboard with a great feel. And while the case has lots of plastic, it seems decently sturdy. The display is pretty good for an inexpensive one - not a rival for my Lenovo. The speaker is pretty loud for a small computer. It boots very quickly and setup was easy and fast and intuitive. The charger is very lightweight and it supports a fast charge protocol. I haven't fully hit the battery life because it's good - but going 9 hours didn't totally deplete it. The wifi connection supports a protocol my Lenovo doesn't so some websurfing may be faster than people used to surfing on older but more powerful laptops.Minuses: Another USB port or two would be nice, but it doesn't have but two. And for serious music, you'll want better speakers/headphones. And manual - well - it's a tiny piece of paper, so if you need details surf the internet, but that's typical for computers these days. And while I didn't slow it much on what I ran, true power users need more than the ASUS, but no $200 computer would meet that need.Biggest plus - under $200 - amazing power for that price. Even if you add Amazon's best deal on a memory card and grab a $7 mouse, with shipping you have a $225 deal. Not sure how they make money on it, but it's a steal. The gold color looks classy.",3,1,5,4,3

This laptop is also very easy to open up and upgrade. I replaced the 1TB HDD with a 512GB SSD with very little effort. The build quality from Dell is excellent and this could easily be a desktop replacement for most people.

Usually I don't write reviews but this is extremely disappointing because I always saw Lenovo as a budget friendly quality product. We bought this laptop for simple tasks such as browsing for products on the web and create basic excel sheets. It did not happen without any frustration. It took forever for the laptop to operate. We were actually deciding between this Lenovo and the Acer Aspire but decided on this one due to the 8GB of RAM. It was a bad decision purchasing this laptop because the computer would freeze as if it was a 5 year old laptop. Websites took MINUTES to load completely and the same goes for opening any application.I do use a Lenovo tower at home and it is magnificent, I wish I can say the same about this Laptop.",1,4,1,3,2
166,"I am not a serious gamer or a techie, but just a guy who uses computers for a variety of reasons, just like everyone else. So you should know that this review is based on the Dell machine itself, and not on Windows 10. I chose a Windows 10 machine because its the operating system that I am most familiar with.Also, this review was written with an understanding that this is a""value-added"" gaming machine, and not a high end or middle range machine. That said, somethings were evidently done with lesser expensive materials so other things could be added and bring the machine into its market niche.Out of the box, set up was easy. The box contains the computer, the charging cord and a piece of paper. Pretty basic. Turning the machine on that first time was easy and set up was nothing out of the ordinary. The cord has a huge transformer on it and there is no short cord option. The machine does not generate an excessive amount of heat during prolonged periods of play or other programs that require a lot of processing power.The operating system sits on a partition on the 128SSD drive, while the ""D"" drive is named ""Data"" is a 1TB HDD. One of the things that you will notice is that everything that comes preloaded (operating system, Anti-Virus, a couple games, and a trial version of Office) resides on the C drive. This uses up 51-52% of that drive's space. I offloaded some stuff I will never use (Disney, Skype, etc.) and it really didn't make a dent in what was resident on the SDD. What did make a huge difference is that my personal choice for Antivirus protection is ESET, not McAfee. So offloading McAfee and installing ESET brought the total SSD usage down to 47%. I set the machine up so that anything and everything can use the HDD aside from the operating system. Crazy? Maybe. I would haven't taken this step had it come with a 256 SDD.On the plus side of the equation, the display is pretty sweet. Colors are good, the graphics card delivers exactly what the description implies. The screen does have a ""wide"" bezel. Again, this is probably one of the trade-offs that Dell needed to make to bring the machine to market.The machine is heavy given how slim it is. Yet the weight is not in the case, which is one of two issues I had with the unit itself. While I am sure it was a trade-off, the plastic body feels cheap. Tap on the frame and you get a soft hollow sound. I would have rather Dell spent a dollar or two per machine and developed a better case.My second, and more critical observation is that the keyboard is not great. It's not even good. It is the lowest standard of adequate. The keys give no feedback when you press them and they are so low to the case that it's easy to lose track of where your fingers are. Sometimes they are on a key, sometimes they are partially on a key. The other thing is that the keys are backlite by blue light, compounding the frustration of the extreme low profile keys. Unless you are in a totally dark room, the blue light wave length makes seeing the keys difficult, especially if you have a vision issue. This, the keyboard, is the weakest part of the computer; I would urge Dell to provide a keyboard with better sensory feedback.Other features are a USB 2.0 on the right side and two 3.0 USB's on the left. An odd little partial flap covers the Ethernet port. They could have saved a few cents there and done away with the flap. We had no problem hooking the machine up to a 32"" monitor for a reunion and using the laptop to run a picture show last Sunday. Lots of ""Ooooh's"" and ""Ahhhh's"".One other feature that I do like is that you can combine this lap with another monitor for dual screens. I know that this is becoming a more common feature, but it works effortlessly.So the bottom-line is that this machine gets four out of five stars. It would have gotten five stars if it weren't for the keyboard. It delivers what it promises, but I think that for a few more dollars you can land a Dell with a better case and keyboard. Still, if you are on a strict budget, this is the way to go.So again, my four out of five-star review is that machine delivers what it promises, but its keyboard is a definite minus.NOTE: I reserve the right to change this review over the next year or so relative to issues of durability or the parts should that problem arise. The addition will appear as an update at the top of the review.",1,0,3,2,2

171,"Provides a fall better experience as a tablet compared to my old iPad. Support for Google Play apps made all the difference! However, I still find issues extending display to a 2nd monitor, and maintaining hotspot session with my iPhone.",2,4,5,4,5
172,"I really liked the look of this small laptop, it's a very pretty light gold color, but not a flashy gold. It is a great laptop for the simpler tasks like email, browsing the web, word processing, and playing movies/ videos. Be aware that the 32gb storage will hardly get you anywhere. After the most recent Windows update that installed after I turned the laptop on, there was about 9gb left (after also installing a some basic programs like Avira, Scrivener, Chrome, Flux, and a few others that are not too large). There is a micro SD card you can insert that you can set to default storage so all programs will install on it and the one I tried was a 200gb micro and it worked fine.The computer is pretty fast but some heavy websites will load slower despite a really fast internet connection. I had several tabs open on Chrome as well as a few basic programs and I didn't find it lagging though, which is good.The screen is one of the biggest problems for me as it is so small, the defaulted resolution and text sizes make the print very tiny so if you like a larger font you will have to increase the zoom, text size, and/or resolution. This makes some programs unable to have their windows show up fully on the screen, which can be a real problem if you don't remember where the OK and Cancel buttons were since you cannot see them if you're in a popup window. In particular, Scrivener has this issue where opening up a window like Tools will not show the bottom of the popup window when you have the zoom increased. The other thing that makes this screen a little difficult is the glossy glare which can make it hard on the eyes and very hard to see outside because it also has very limited tilt on the screen so your viewing angles are not the best at times. I do find that the screen is very bright and crisp and slightly better than ASUS VivoBook R416SA-EH21 14"", which is the larger, slightly better version of this laptop.The keyboard is my favorite part of this laptop since it is a full keyboard but it has smaller keys and they are closer together. It is fantastic for those that have smaller hands and shorter fingers like me. The keys are chiclet so they click almost like a mechanical keyboard and those are my favorite. It is very easy and smooth to type on.The laptop I received has a good trackpad that glides nicely and has very responsive click buttons. The only thing I had issues with are the multi-touch gestures where you can use two or three fingers to scroll vertically and horizontally. Scrolling vertically with two fingers seemed to make the mouse move all over, despite how careful I was with making sure my two fingers were together and making contact at the same time. The scroll worked most of the time but when it didn't you sometimes accidentally clicked and moved things you didn't mean to.Overall I would give this pc a 8 out of 10. You cannot beat the small weight of a little over 2lbs for this price point and hardware, that is one of the big pluses if you want the ultimate portability. It's perfect for those that don't mind the trackpad issues or smaller screen/font size issues, but for my purpose, which was for writing short stories, I think the issue with having to make the font so much larger to see it comfortably will be a deal breaker since I use Scrivener primarily.If you want something a little larger with a little more power, I would recommend the larger version of this laptop, the ASUS VivoBook R416SA-EH21 14"", which is only 1lb heavier.ASUS VivoBook R416SA-EH21 14"" Full HD Laptop (Quad-Core N3700, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 128GB eMMC, Windows 10), Metallic Gray",3,1,5,4,3

Actually best laptop keyboard I've ever worked with.- IPS monitor.- It doesn't looks ridiculous like on pictures. It was the biggest concern of mine about this laptop, so it is a big pro for me. It looks a bit aggressive though, with all lights on (which you can turn off) but nothing more.Cons:- Heavy. Along with the adapter, which has a weight and a shape of a real brick, it makes a pretty heavy kit. For someone it is a desktop replacement, but I personally bought a dedicated Predator bag, which makes it somehow portable. - Fingerprints. If you have a cleaning kit and clean your laptop daily after work/gaming it won't be a problem at all.- Thermal solution. It is not great. But it is a common problem. I changed mine after a week of use and it helped to drop something like 15-20 degree Celsius. It could put to the end your warranty though, so think for yourself.- IPS backlight bleed. Mine arrived with very little bleed in the top right corner. Can see it in absolutely dark scenes on full brightness.Overall:Great laptop for the money.

I tried to download pictures from an sd card and that was a complete nightmare. It was worse than slow. It would have taken atleast week to download 500 pics. This purchase was a complete mistake.

First of all, I'm a freelance writer and photographer, so I will be heavily using Microsoft Office, GIMP, Grammarly, and Spotify. Here are my first impressions (I'll update this review as needed).Pros:I was able to load everything very quickly. It seems like the AMD9 processor is going to do the job well.I've had no problem multitasking thanks to the SSD and 8GB RAMIt's ultra lightweight, which is good because I already have a camera body and a few lenses in my backpack.The 14-inch 1080p screen is way better than the standard def 15.6-inch screen on my old laptop.The built-in SD drive saves me a USB port.Cons:There's no separate keypad on the keyboard, but that is to be expected on a very small laptop.Cortana is obnoxious during startupI had to get rid of a ton of preloaded stuff I didn't want.The video memory is shared (won't matter to me, but I wanted to mention this for gamers or video editors)Let's be honest, it can't match up to the desktop I built for myself specifically to run my business. That having been said, it's a simple and cost-effective way to keep running my business as I travel the world (which is the whole point of my business). I recommend this laptop for freelance writers and photographers, but the shared video RAM is a no-no for video editing or heavy gaming.",1,4,3,2,3
187,"Conceptually, this PC is a powerful little devil, but (a) its main retail package includes Windows 10 Home (oh-lord...ah), and (b) it is unforgivably flimsy (as most game laptops are, but still...). Specifically, I bought the version with the 500GB SSD and 16GB RAM, and then I added a 2.5"" HDD that I bought elsewhere, which allowed me to use the SSD for programs and the HDD for storage/docs.***The biggest pros include: 7700HQ processor, NVIDIA GTX 1050 video, near-full-size keyboard with num pad, non-glossy screen, drive bays for both SSD and HDD, plus ease of one-screw disassembly and access to battery, memory, and SSD/HDD (disassembly would be sooo painful if I instead were to buy the competing Asus VivoBook such as the M580VD-EB76... which I seriously considered FYI).***The biggest cons include: large form factor (the laptop footprint is much bigger than the size of the screen), Windows 10 Home (let's face it, the Home version is trash... and if you don't know that yet, you will soon), flimsy hinges (so flimsy I feel guilty opening and closing the lid), flimsy back panel (thin and weak), flimsy gills (the red-colored metal radiator gills are cute but are made of tin foil, quite literally... super-extra flimsy), flimsy body (so flimsy I can bend it visibly by using only two fingers of each hand to twist it in opposite directions), no video out except one HDMI port (you will need to buy USB to VGA Video Graphics Adapters to extend your desktop, which are $30 to $35 each - by the way, I recommend the ones made by Pluggable brand), and finally, with Windows 10 Home edition this PC is simply NOT cheap.***One last tip: people who say that the sub-woofer on this laptop makes it sound awesome are either deaf or have really low expectations or working for Dell - ignore them and accept the fact that the sub-woofer is going to suck, and all subwoofers sized like a penny always suck. But also remember, Dell has simply never been great at delivering awesome speaker audio systems. I recall how a few years ago I was seconds ago from clicking the ORDER button on Amazon to buy a new ""entertainment laptop""... but while eyeballing the features for the last time on the page, I noticed that this so-called ""entertainment"" (ssssh.....) laptop had just one - that's not two but one, ladies and gentlemen - speaker on it. What does this tell you? This tells you how Dell sees audio as part of a laptop - they think great audio is - well - nice but not required. Hence the subwoofer that doesn't look or sound like one.***In conclusion, would I recommend this laptop? Yes, but only - and I mean ONLY - if size factor isn't super important to you AND if you are concerned with being able to easily open the back panel to tweak your system, which is one thing that this laptop does like no other: it requires removal of just ONE SCREW to remove the entire back panel for access to the guts (and as you may have suspected, I am very pleased with that!)",1,0,1,2,2
188,"I have had this laptop for a little over a month now and am really happy with it. It is a good middle of the road laptop. It is light and slim which makes it great for traveling and working online.Pros:- Very light and portable but doesn't feel chintzy. It seems to be constructed well.-The i5 does pretty well. The onboard graphics will bottleneck in certain situations, though, I have only encountered this when gaming.-As just mentioned this will handle light gaming. I play Skyrim with medium settings and have good framerate any more than that and it will bog down. I was able to play overwatch as well but had to do a lot of fiddling with the graphics to get it to run smooth.-This is my first computer with an SSD and I love them. From the time you push power, you can be opening your web browser in 15 seconds. It also helps with the dreaded windows update. It takes SIGNIFICANTLY less time to update.-The harman/kardon speakers are great they have a good sound quality for a laptop speaker and are plenty loud.-The battery life is very good. It will stay charged for 5 or 6 hours while gaming while connected to the internet and full brightness. Essentially, you will have 5 to 6 hours of battery at the least. You can get at least 12 hours with light use.-A common complaint about this laptop is a loud fan. I haven't experienced this at all. Mine is very quiet and works well.- I use it for photo editing via lightroom and it does well.Cons:-The screen doesn't have a wide range of motion. It probably only goes to 100 degrees or so.-As I said you can do light gaming with this but if you a really into gaming and want to play with high settings this isn't for you.Overall this laptop is great for work a little above your typical internet streaming and word processing. This is probably the best value you will find before moving into the Ultrabook tier.",3,3,3,2,4

191,"Coming from a $2000 gaming desktop and a MacBook pro, I didn't know what to expect from a chromebook other than what I have read online. I was looking for a replacement for my MacBook, but I didn't want or need to spend so much money on a laptop that I would mainly be doing web browsing on (I can use my desktop for anything that requires real muscle). All I have to say is that this is definitely 'The Little Laptop That Could'. I usually have pretty high expectations for my devices being in the IT field, but wow has this thing surpassed my expectations. It is quick and snappy and handles most tasks without even breaking a sweat. For web browsing, this is all the laptop you need. I am heavily invested in google services (google drive, gmail, google photos, google play music, etc.) so this works perfectly, but I would say that if you are not a big google user, especially if you don't use google drive or gmail, a chromebook might not be the best laptop for you. What makes this laptop even better though is the ability to use android apps, so for some light photoshop or lightroom work, I can use the android app which works flawlessly. The display on this thing is second to none, and the keyboard, while small, feels just like my macbook. The two biggest gripes that people have (the small keyboard and the lack of keyboard back lighting), are over exaggerated and I have never had a problem with them.Pros:- amazing screen- ChromeOS is a pleasure to work with- keyboard & trackpad are excellent- build quality is better than $1000+ windows/mac laptops- battery life is awesome- integration with google services is seamless- very easy to use for both novices and professionals- touch screen and stylus are a good bonusCons:- OP1 chipset can stutter sometimes, if you'll be doing HEAVY work on Chrome you might want to go with a chromebook with an m3 processor or betterOverall: This is the best money I have spent on a tech product in a long time. If I find continued success with ChromeOS I might permanently migrate to it",2,4,5,4,5
192,"Lags a LOT. Like.. a lot. Online gaming, loading webpages, even just booting up takes FOREVER and sometimes the screen glitches out and causes odd black squares to appear. Mind you, this is a NEW machine. Trackpad is VERY VERY bad, you'd need an external mouse. If not plugged into the charger, keyboard lights go off way too often. and if played on a lap, the speakers are muted because they're in an odd place. Not worth the price!",2,0,1,0,2

194,"so far so good. only tiny issue is that little circle that shows up next to the cursor/pointer that indicates the computer is ""thinking"" or doing something. That comes on a lot and only way to get rid of it is to cntrl+alt+del and then task manager and then close out the task manager. then it goes away. if you know your way around a pc then you know what I'm talking about.Everything still works whether the little circle appears or not. it's just annoying.",2,2,1,2,2

196,"I had this laptop for almost 6 months. It is a nice design. But the keyboard had a couple useless keys at the end of the right. It can run basic apps and animation apps well. Gaming is not that great, but is still OK. It is a little slow sometimes. I only get 12 GB storage after Windows 10 Installation. When I accidentally hit my iPhone to the laptop screen, it had a tiny crack between where I hitted it. Trackpad is really horrible and can not work once in a while because it is creaky and slippery. Overall, this is a good basic laptop for normal usage.",3,4,5,4,3
197,"I received it 2 weeks ago and so far so good.Just a few notes for the potential buyers and the one who are still not sure whether to purchase it or not.1- Out of the box every thing was fine, but the WiFi download speed. It was terrible and I were sure something is wrong. I normally have around 50 Mbps download and around 100 Mbps upload speed. However, with this laptop it was around 1 Mbps download and almost 100 Mbps upload speed. I searched the web, but there were some wrong info. I reinstalled windows, updated WiFi driver through device manager but it was not the solution. The only solution was to update the Windows to the latest version (Windows 10 Fall Creators Update) and afterward upgrading the WiFi driver via the Intel's website (I mean downloading the driver from intel's website not the device manager). Now every thing is fine and the download and upload speed are as they should be.2- Besides the above mentioned issue, the most important issue, is the fan noise. I mean it starts working when you don't believe it is necessary and makes of course noise. I haven't checked the CPU temperature, but I found the cooling fan active when I was downloading a bis software package and installing some others which I believe is not that much. However, it seems it's due to the thickness of the laptop and it gets warm very quick.3- Last but not least, although the production quality is fine enough, the casing material (The Aluminium alloy I think) is not that great. You can easily feel the difference with a high-end laptop body like Apple MacBooks. However, that's not bad at all, it's just not premium.For the best parts, I would choose first the weight. You can't imagine how thin and light is that. Furthermore, the battery last for almost the whole day and you can be sure that you won't get out of charge through the day. Although ASUS claims 12 hours, for the mixes tasks like internet browsing, movie watching, some office works and general university stuff, you can be sure to have at least 8 hours of charge.All in all, I rate this great machine 5 star, since price-wise it's even more than the best. You get the latest Intel Core i5 together with 8GB RAM and 256 SSD in s very thin and light body just for 750$. That's great and I am satisfied till now.",3,3,3,2,4
198,"Awesome deal. For this price, you get a lot. It has a nice keyboard with decent travel on the keys, powerful specs, a nice working active pen and touch screen, and an overall nice build quality. I wish the casing was aluminum, but for this price, hard plastic is tolerable.",3,2,3,2,4
199,Its a great laptop. I am very happy with it.,2,2,1,2,2
200,"Got a 64 GB card to go along with the machine and absolutely love this machine. Looks great, battery time is awesome, keyboard typing experience is good and the trackpad surpasses the quality of many Windows laptops I've used.",3,1,5,4,3
201,"I've had to deal with two broken models of this laptop. The first laptop I received was wonderful. It could play older games like Civilization 4 (and could actually even play Call of Duty 4 on low settings with reasonable frame rates), it could do word processing, it was light, fast enough; it seemed like the perfect budget laptop... except that it had a broken SD card slot. Mechanically broken- if I put an SD card in I could not get it out without using a special tool of some sort. So I ordered a replacement. This one wasn't mechanically broken- instead it would have the drive randomly unmount! This would happen completely sporadically and unpredictably. Sometimes it would simply read that there was 0 mb free, sometimes it wouldn't even appear on my PC at all. Two laptops, two broken SD slots! Absolutely unacceptable. Very disappointed.",3,1,5,4,3
202,"I purchased this as a replacement for an Asus X205TA I got last year, and the performance is AMAZING! What struck me most was the display color difference. Everything is more saturated and sharper with this laptop.I thoroughly enjoy that this is a 4GB compared to the standard 2GB for computers this size. I am a self-confessed tab addict, and the 2GB tends to panic once you go past about 8 tabs. Especially while shopping, being able to open 20 tabs at once is incredibly helpful. Another thing this helps with is the performance on processing-heavy sites such as Shutterfly. My previous computer flat-out refused to do it, while this one doesn't complain at all.I adore the small size, as it allows me to type from a normal keyboard, but gives me essentially the portability of a tablet. I mean, this thing fits in my purse! And as someone with mobility issues, the ridiculously light weight of this computer is wonderful.Pretty much the only negative things I can say about it dare that the little rubber feet on the bottom of Asus 11.6's tend to slide off fairly quickly (about three or four months in), and that you need to transfer your music via USB rather than a direct rip, as they don't have optical drives. It should be fairly obvious that if you're a picture hoarder, you're going to need an external hard drive, but those are much cheaper than they used to be now!For this incredible price, a 4GB 11.6 inch is gonna be impossible to find elsewhere. Grab one while you can!",3,1,5,4,3
203,"Bought this about a month ago and had to return the first one as a couple of the letter keys started sticking on day two. This one has worked well, but the battery life has not been good. I am lucky to get five hours. I did buy the one year warranty on the second one as I have seen numerous reports of problems a couple of months after purchase. This is my first chrome book after using iPads for years. Overall it is a decent machine and the price was reasonable.",2,4,5,4,5

208,"This is a $200 computer. I know that's obvious, but seriously, think about it. A normal computer should cost around $700, right?I already have a good laptop, but it's a bit bulky and I wanted something smaller that I could take while traveling. I figured, I'm not using it for games or photo editing, the most I need it to do is run Word. I thought this computer could handle that.Honestly, I've ready good reviews about ASUS, but this is my first ASUS computer. And it's also my first computer running Windows 10. So I don't know exactly where to lay the blame, but this thing is brand new and slower than my 5 year old laptop. If I'm running Excel and try to open an image file, there's a good 30% chance that alone will overload this poor excuse for a computer.So, if you're looking for a $200 paperweight that's in the shape of a computer, here you go.",3,1,5,4,3

I usually have to wait a full 2 minutes for the computer to function again. We have an older laptop (with worse graphics) that never freezes.For gaming, my husband turned the graphics all the way down on Overwatch. He says there's still a bit of a lag, making the game unplayable in competitive mode since the response time will mess up your ability to do well.",1,0,3,2,2

217,"Chromebook person here 5 years in. Best Chromebook to date. Microsoft 365 (from the Android Play store) closes the enormous gap in my business world which NEEDS Microsoft Word and Excel compatibility (this is enormous, this break-through cannot be overstated... yes, you WILL need a Microsoft 365 subscription to maximize... but the fact that this licensing-gap has officially finally been closed is huge ...HUGE!!!). Picture/brightness/definition of picture-video is unbelievably good (and the odd-ball aspect-ratio showcases video and web-sites in such a nice way). This snappy-ass machine has such an instant no-hiccup response to my touch-pad and mouse. Solid nice build (weight, dimensions, etc are all spot-on). Only reason not a five-star rating is two-fold... One, the outer metal'ish top-surface scratches easily (a major problem which I expect will and certainly needs to be fixed in future versions). And two, when opened up in laptop position, the weight of the top screen-half (if opened 91+ degrees) lifts the right-corner of the bottom keyboard-half closest to me up from the surface by about a half a millimeter (which creates slight rocking, which is a pretty big ouch... but I am guessing that this flaw is just a one-off flaw that is not to be expected in all Chromebook Plusses across the board). This said; unless you drop full-blown coin on the Pixel Book, Samsung's Plus might very will be the best there is to get at this moment in (our relatively young) Chromebook history.",2,4,5,4,5

219,"I don't know if I just got a bad one or what but the screen was gawd awful. I just couldn't get a good viewing angle on it. If I looked straight ahead at it it was too bright and washed out and hurt the eyes to read. In order to get a halfway decent viewing angle I had to lean the screen back about 10 degrees from a normal viewing angle. Any head movement up down, left or right gives you a washed out screen. I tried messing with the intel color display settings to no avail. This is probably the worst screen I have seen on any computer in my lifetime. Maybe I just got a lemon. I found it unusable.As for the rest of the computer, I didn't find it sluggish at all. It loaded up web pages and word documents just fine. Even ran MS flight simulator 2004 just fine. Of course I wouldn't even attempt to do any video editing on it or heavy spreadsheets. I could even deal with the 32gb. What I can't deal with is an overly bright washed out screen.I found the build quality to be about what you would expect for a $220 laptop. Cheap screen, really cheap plastic touchpad that makes a noise every time you touch it. Plastic keys. Plastic throughout. While the laptop doesn't show any fingerprints it sure shows oily hands. I'm not sure what's worse, fingerprints or oil. Another thing I didn't like is the way it looks when the laptop is closed. Take a good look at the pics. When it's closed, the lid doesn't completely cover the laptop. It has about 3/8ths an inch down the side that is just for the hinges. Looks funky.I can only recommend this laptop for a child where none of my complaints would matter. If the rest of the screens are like mine was, you're not going to like it. I'm going back to my trusty Acer Chromebook 14 with a lovely IPS screen and quality throughout. What I really want is my Acer Chromebook 14 hardware with Windows 10. I'm thinking Acer's Swift series.",3,4,5,4,3

I called customer service. Since everything else in our house is tapped into wifi except for this laptop, and we did the factory reset, the 2nd customer service person advised to send the laptop to on of their service centers. However, this rep would not compensate for shipping. This person said our computer was defective yet we had to pay for shipping it to a service center, even if the laptop is covered under warranty.

I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro so I could use legacy software. The laptop has enough processing power for anything I've used it for and is nice and light. The keyboard is comfortable, the trackpad is smooth and accurate and the battery life is enough to get through most of the day with the performance and screen brightness jacked up.The screen is excellent and the build is solid. The fabric on the keyboard is holding up after four months' use and feels good.I'd be happy if they made the laptop a bit thicker put a bigger battery in it and upped the storage, but I feel that way about all my electronics.

I instead installed the default Windows drivers, and magically there were no more issues with sound.Even though I had to play with the drivers to fix the sound, I still consider it to be a solid buy.

Not a big deal when on the web but when watching watching a movie and the background became dark, it was annoying. See the photo.I heard good things about Asus customer support which is one of the main reasons I got the computer. I let them know about the problem and they responded once asking if I dropped it to which I told them no and then never heard back even after a couple more attempts. At that point I initiated a return with Amazon who of course was great.The aluminum body is nice but I was not impressed with the build quality because it has a lot of flex to it.

302,"I bought this laptop at the beginning of 2018. It's a cheap, yet decent for the price, refurbished laptop. However, after I unboxed it, I found they hadn't set it for OOBE (Out Of Box Experience), which is how most computers are initially set, so you can customize some of the settings and create your user account. And, certain things didn't work, like the Start/Windows button. It was somewhat unusable in that state, so I did a complete reinstall of Windows. (Thankfully, I'm a computer tech by trade, and have already done this stuff plenty of times before.) Also, upgraded the memory from 4 to 8 GB. Not terrible to get apart and not too many screws to worry about. You pretty much just pry the plastic shell from the bottom to get to the electronics. Also, as a side note, the refurbisher slipped in a single half-sheet of paper explaining what was included with the laptop. Fine, but the part where they wrote that Microsoft Works, not Office, was the current productivity software was a bit of a head scratcher. Works had been discontinued in 2009. Not trying to be harsh, but I'm not sure what happened there. Despite that, the laptop looked and operated fine. But, if I weren't a tech, I can imagine the frustration I'd be going through.",3,1,2,4,2
303,The battery does not hold a charge. The computer must be plugged in to operate.,3,2,2,4,2

305,"I returned it. I was skeptical of the reviews on here saying it didn't have enough memory to even update windows, but they were true. I had it for a couple of weeks and it kept giving me error messages because there wasn't enough space to update. I didn't download much onto it, just Microsoft Office, which is a necessity since I am a student. I saved all files on a removable drive, but even the basic operating system was too much for the small amount of storage space. It might be good from someone only doing web based stuff, but if you're going to need to download even basic stuff, don't buy this laptop.",3,1,5,4,3

I am not a gamer but I do create art in Photoshop and prefer working at a minimum of 1200 dpi. This laptop was recommended to me by a friend who knows everything about everything. (He is a god or an alien I suspect.) For the short time I had this laptop Photoshop Elements 15 worked like a dream with files large enough to shut down a computer with 4G ram. Anyway, I wish I hadn't received a lemon but am considering trying again.

Over twice what I've seen for gaming laptops in the same price range. 8 hours if all settings are reduced. About 2 hours playing a mid-range game.CONS:Not enough to take a star off for, since it is still better than models that cost $200 more.Keyboard a bit cramped and will take some getting used to.Screen a little dim in sunlight.",2,0,3,2,2
327,"Overall, Im very impressed with this laptop and consider the price to be quite reasonable.Specifically:Listed as a lightweight laptop, Id place it in the higher end of that classification, or even as a lower-end middleweight. Ive used a number of laptops that were lighter than this one, though its certainly portable enough to carry around for a day.Battery/power: The battery is supposed to last for 9 hours. Mine was dead to begin with and needed charging right out of the box, but it only took about an hour to charge up. I like the design of the power cord: the heavier segment that connects to the wall outlet and the adapter is shorter, making the cord lighter.Setup: Easy as pie to put together and setup. Quick and immediate hookup to the Internet. Cute greeting as you get started customizing the computer, though it doesnt offer a time to finish updates or percentages on how far its gotten, so best to leave it alone to do its workabout 10 minutesand come back later. Theres another, brief delay (a few minutes) for more updates later on in the process. Opens up with a lovely seascape screensaver. THIS LAPTOP DOES NOT COME WITH THE MICROSOFT OFFICE PACKAGE. YOU HAVE TO ORDER AND PAY FOR IT SEPARATELY (WPS OFFICE is included on the system DVD that comes with this laptop but no product key is provided to activate it).Internet: The browser offered is Microsoft Edge. Opens to an advertisement for Edge. Pretty fast page loads, though Ive seen quicker (to be fair some of the other, later uploads on this machine were lightning fast, as quick as Ive seen). Online videos play smoothly and easily, without hiccups. Full screen videos look great. Sound is set, to begin with, at 67 percent.Fingerprint ID: Nice touch (literally). Cool function for added security.Keyboard: The pad and clicker is placed to one side, the left, which can take getting used to. I've found myself right-clicking something by mistake because of the offset design.Connections/Memory: Love the dozen ports on the left side available for connecting to other units in a variety (5) of different modes. Also a headphone and another port on the right side. Comes with a DVD/CD player/drive (right side); no DVD player comes with this unit (youd have to purchase one), though you can play music CDs on the Windows Media Player. This unit comes with a quick-and-easy switch-out setup for replacing memory--just a few minutes to complete--which I think is fantastic.Installation DVD that comes with this laptop includes ASUS Business Manager; USB Charger; WPS Office; Winflash (which, for some reason, wouldnt play a functional DVD on this app after I downloaded it; actually, I couldnt find it on my laptop after downloading, either, even after rebooting, which is weird); and Touchpad Handwriting. Be advised that youll have to re-enter the computer after each download, using your password (automatic restart, over and over and over; a hassle, bite the bullet, get it done).All in all, as I say, a nice laptop with lots of memory (8 gigabytes of RAM memory, a full terabyte on the hard drive).",2,2,1,2,2

329,My son love this computer came on time very fast processor,1,0,1,2,2
330,This computer is wonderful and a great investment. Keep in mind that the computer may run a bit slow at first due to the fact that Windows 10 installs and updates the computer without verifying first. This can slow down your downloads. You also cannot download from steam and browse the web at the same time but that is a steam issue and not the computer itself. All of the games we have run very well on this computer. You do not have to turn down the graphics on any game.,2,0,1,2,2

There was one little issue with Windows 10 not booting up one day, so I told/showed her to hit the F5 button to get the home screen run the anti-virus and restart it again.

340,"The hard drive is a weak point in this laptop. Replace with a SSD and you've got a really solid budget laptop. I've had massive problems with Windows services locking things up (automatic updates thrashing hard drive, Defender locking up CPU, etc.), but I've no particular reason to place the blame on the laptop. Windows 10 is neither respectful nor considerate of the user. It's in charge and will do what it likes. I'd recommend Win 7 if you have an applicable license.",2,2,1,2,2
341,"At first, everything worked well. I upgraded to regular Windows 10 so that I can install software unlike previous Windows version. Everything worked great for 3 months. The only issue I had was the face recognition sign in, which seemed to only work about a fifth of the time. It's also a pity that the monitor wasn't 360 degrees too. However, overall I really liked the laptop. It was nice and light, and could fit in my purse really well. However, after 3 months, it just stopped working without any reason. There was no physical damage to the laptop whatsoever, I simply closed it like normal one night, and it wouldn't boot up 2 hours later. Monitor went black, and only the keyboard would light up. So while it was working, it worked great despite the iffy face recognition sign in. The touch screen was sensitive enough, and it woke up from sleep reasonably well timed. I've contacted Microsoft support and thankfully there is a 1 year warrante, however, it means they will simply just probably replace it with refurbished one. It's a bit saddening that it only lasted 3 months or so and that now anything on it will be wiped. Hopefully, the next laptop will be longer lasting. Overall, in working shape, it was relatively a 4 star. My only complaints were the face sign in, it wasn't 360 degrees bendable, and the magnetic charging chord often would fall out.",0,2,3,2,4

Also a heads up on future buyers it will not read the Nvidia out of the box you must configure it to load off of it or it will use the intigrated Intel graphics (and we all know what that's like) but once it's configured it can run just pretty much anything fluctuating between 45-60fps but because it is a 1050 I recommend getting a laptop docking fan because it will get hot over long term use. Otherwise great product Acer",2,0,1,0,2
344,I bought a refurbished unit and it works perfectly. I use it mainly to connect to the internet and work in the cloud. It has been problem free. The price was outstanding.,2,2,5,4,2
345,"I am going to preface this with the statement that I am not a tech nerd or even remotely tech knowledgeable. I can only really comment on the laptop as I see it and how it performs for me. Please feel free to look at other reviewers if you want more technical information. The outward appearance is absolutely stunning. The casing has a solid sturdy feel that is a major improvement from the plastic cased laptops I've had over the years. It is very sleek and the lack of screws and venting make for smooth, uninterrupted lines. There is fabric on the deck and I have to say that it's one of the best highlights of the machine. Normally I end up with sweaty or sticky palms/wrists when typing for an extended period of time, but not anymore. The laptop also generates far less heat than any I have ever used before. I don't have to put it on top of a pillow when I'm sitting on the couch and it seems to stay pretty cool to the touch. The keypad and track pad are total stunners on this machine. Both seem almost perfect in their response and tactile feeling. I like the back-lighting adjustment feature for the keypad so that I can conserve battery power when using it at night. I am also impressed with the speakers and how they are located under the keyboard, keeping the deck looking sleek and slimmed down. They do put out very good sound for laptop speakers too. I have noticed people complaining about the lack of USB-C ports.......I don't really know what that is. This machine has enough for what I need to use, and I am assuming for general day to day use it will suit people just fine. The speed and performance are also on the higher end of what I am used to for general computing/word processing and other type of functions. I have a TV and a tablet already, so I am not using this for gaming or movie watching. I think that for most people who want a computer for general day to day use, this will be perfect fit. The last bit is about the OS. I have to agree with other reviewers on this portion.....it's not very useful at all. It is really the only negative thing I have to say about this laptop, and it's easily remedied anyway. Overall, if you are looking to upgrade to something that's high end, without dealing with too high of a price or more machine than you actually need, this Surface has it all. I feel like I get the aesthetics of a Mac with the familiarity and ease of use in a PC.",1,2,3,2,4
346,"I like the laptop. Light wt, touch screen is excellent with good resolution, super quiet, SDD is amazing ( first time owning one). Fast enough with me running photoshop 2017.

363,"I've had this laptop for about three months, and this is the second laptop (after the Rose Gold MacBook), that I have looked forward to using day in and day out. It is a weird feeling, being in love with your laptop. Most of us have probably own at least 6 laptops in our lifetimes, so you can understand where I'm coming from when I say most of us use our laptops in a utilitarian sort of way: We use it because we need to, and when we don't, we just put it away without any thought. If you want a big screen, or to play games, you would use your desktop. When you want something portable, you would most likely use your tablet. When you want something on the go, we have all used our smartphone as our main day-to-day gadget. So that leaves our laptop, as more of a business machine for doing something that requires typing on the go, whether it be to reply to an important email you can't just use your phone for, or to type out something on Word or Google Docs. For many of us, browsing the Net just isn't as satisfying on our small phones, even if it is some 6.2"" monster. There is something tactile, yet intangibly indescribable, about using our laptopYet, this is the first Windows laptop that makes me look forward to using it each day. The main culprit: Oh that gorgeous piece of metal and color. To be honest, if it just came in silver like its Surface Book counterpart, I would have never given it a second thought (by the way, I have that too, but its novelty has since worn off). I got the Burgundy version, which is just so unique - where else can you get a wine red laptop?? Each time I open its laptop sleeve and pull it out, I have to pause a moment to admire its chiseled look first, before propping it open and using it. Not only does it look great, it feels great too. As you run your fingers through it, you will appreciate that you have one of the most luxurious laptops ever. No that is not a hyperbole.Another thing that make it stands out: The stereo speakers underneath the keyboard is the best I have ever heard in a laptop (I am overseas right now, and my Huawei Matebook X awaits at home with its Dolby Atmos Harmon Kardon speakers, so I'll do an update soon). It is loud and immersive - it can't get too loud where it would create aural distortions, so at its peak it is just awesomely loud and clear enough. I have a keyboard protector over it, but I always take it off when I have some audio playing - yes, the sound is that good.Touchscreen laptops might be a gimmick, but having it is never a negative. It is perfect for scrolling web sites. Once you use it that way, you'll never go back to scrolling with your mouse or trackpad again.Speaking of the trackpad, it's supposed to have the Windows Precision software aspect, but it still is goofy most of the time. Scrolling, switching, zooming, etc., still isn't as good as any MacBooks.And speaking of the keyboard and keyboard cover, key travel and sponginess are excellent. However, the keys are a bit more slippery than I would like, so I definitely recommend one of those gel keyboard covers to help you type more precisely.The screen is bright and excellent - one of the best screens I have used. The resolution isn't as crisp and nice as my Surface Book and Macbook, but definitely better than most.About that whole Alcantara-layered interior - yes it is beautiful, yes it feels great (no more cold palms in the winter). Just keep it clean (no eating potato chips while using it).Finally, the i5 and 8GB of RAM are good enough to avoid any hiccups in performance of your every usage of a normal laptop. This is not for gaming or video rendering, so if you are not expecting that, then this laptop's performance will not disappoint.The bottom line is you will buy this laptop for its looks, period. There is no value for this laptop - it is targeted as a premium-level laptop, not a value-level laptop. Any other normal laptop with these specs would be about $200 less. So you just have to ask yourself if the burgundy or slate blue color, and the style of design/craftsmanship are worth it for you.",0,2,3,2,4
364,Love the laptop but didn't get my info on warranty I bought,3,4,5,4,3
365,"Great laptop. The only cons that I saw:- its the weight (5.6 pound) if you need to travel- The temperature located around the letters uiop, jkl; and ,./ on the keyboard. Yo can feel the heat in that section when youre using around 50% or 8GB Ram (16GB RAM Total) and a lot of process in your pc. As I use a wireless keyboard, It doesnt affect me the heat sensation on keyboard.- Laptop screen. Its ok... the colors are not very intense. Its a shame because it has powerful component. Im using 2 additional monitor, so it doesnt bother me anyway. For gaming its recommended that you use the hdmi built in port.But in overall its incredible fast without freezing moments at the moment ( using it by 45 days almost continuous)",1,0,1,2,2

Tried to return it but Amazon wanted me to prepay the shipment internationally from Chile. It would cost 10 times of what DHL charge Amazon.Will have to settle for a local repair at my cost. And how I hate windows 10. This has a very small processor, 1 ghz about third of the size of my desktopwhich is 3ghz. For windows 10 not a good idea.Too bad! It is a handsome looking machine..",3,2,1,4,2

372,"I Love this Chromebook. I love the small keyboard. I love how light it is. I love the size of the screen. I love the resolution. I love that it is a chromebook, and I don't have to go wading through installed programs to figure out what is making everything slow down. Ditto for worrying about a virus or malware. For people who are still working on a laptop, man, I hope you have to work with some heavy duty software, because otherwise you are missing out. My husband has a straight chromebook and it is great, but app compatibility and the memory with the Pro makes this the bridge for actually working with a chromebook. I took an online class and was able to download the plugin for Adobe Connect, no problem. Although the mike was a little laggy. I prefer to work on this so much that I have really explored the wealth of apps out there to make everything work. It's like the undiscovered country working with a full fledged browser and the app store. So when other students are trying to figure out how to edit pdf files-- do they have to buy 365, or Adobe?-- I am already in Dochub. This is an expensive chromebook-- but it still doesn't have the monetary value of a laptop-- but when my kid spilled a cup of tea on it, and I could spend $150 repairing or ditch it, I repaired it immediately. And then I sat on my hands until it came. And then gave thanks to have my favorite electronic back again.",2,4,5,4,5
373,This was the worst purchase I ever made from Amazon.The laptop did not even come with microsoft 10....,2,2,1,3,1
374,"Have now used this laptop for two months and can recommend it. Before buying it, you have to understand what you are purchasing...this is not a gaming computer or a laptop with high functionality. What it can do is provide a device that can deliver basic daily needs...email, streaming, surf the web, social media. I use this laptop mainly to watch Youtube, Twitch and even Netflix for movies for the simple fact that it is so light, I have no problem moving from room to room if needed...like when I decide to go cook...just get up and go. You can literally carry it with one hand no problem. Some have said it's slow...I have not encountered any speed issues. Not as fast as my other laptops but there isn't this huge lag problem. For example...youtube videos play straight on, even when you advance forward...it picks up at that point and goes. No problem with live stream videos either. Battery life is sufficient. Can watch several hours of vids.Biggest draw back of course is memory. But again you get what you pay for. You can add a dew things but don't expect this to hold your music library and/or media library and a multitude of extras. If you need a device to store...this is not for you. But if you need a secondary, or even third laptop to watch vids and social media etc...lightweight vs a full specced out laptop...and something that if dropped or stolen...you wouldn't feel too upset about because there is literally nothing on it of value because it's just for media consumption vs a work computer...this is a good laptop that runs a very familiar OS in Windows.UPDATE: May 22, 2018.....Definitely need external memory for Windows updates. Could have bought a 32gb USB but went ahead and bought a 250gb external hard drive just to have the space. The added $35 cost for HD brings total for this laptop to ~ $250. If purchasing...buy extra memory for it right away (or be prepared to use what you have already) and add that amount to your cost analysis when comparing vs other devices.",3,4,5,4,3

How on earth ASUS provides this computer with such a 5hItty OS, anyway there is a solution: I installed Lmint 18.10 and incredibly I discovered that this computer has a powerful hardware, applications run smoothly, the battery lasts for more than 12 hours and powers up in the less than 10s.",3,1,5,4,3

380,"My first impressions where Wow, woa & WoW! But then I was shocked when I noticed the device would simply shut down if I put it on its side. Don't get me wrong It is really sharp looking and seems fast. It has a slick looking responsive touchscreen that is about the size of a regular piece of paper and nice contours. I thought to myself this can basically do everything I need. Sure I would have to ""adapt"" to the samsung power chord and adjust to doing all my work via apps and the cloud but that seemed kind of exciting. And, my first doodles with the s-pen weren't worth saving though I looked forward to the many drawing sessions I dreamed of. Unfortunately the beautiful device that my samsung chromebook is, it still has an issue with turning off when on its side in tablet mode. It whites out and turns off if I simply set it up right on it's side. So, I am once again heartbroken by a samsung product, like the note 7, That had everything I needed but one crucial part and now I am left without an option other than to buy from another manufacturer once again.",2,4,5,4,5

Unfortunately. I am not incredibly tech savvy and liked how easy it is to use, but I don't make enough money to throw away on electronics.

390,"General Overall Review Before In Depth ReviewPros:*Powerful graphics card at a cheap price*Decent processor will get everything you need done fast*Comes with a SSD over a standard HDd*1080p resolution to watch Full HD content*Backlit keyboard to operate in the darkness*Not too heavy*Has a nice exterior design*Computer distributes heat well and fans keep it cool*Can expand hard drive storage with HDD or SSDCons:*Plastic material can make it feel cheap*Fans get loud when playing graphic intense games*Battery life is mediocre but if you use it as a gaming desktop alternative you'll keep the power plugged in*250GB storage (I won't say it's a con because of the price and the fact its a SSD which is better for gaming, if it was a 250GB HDD then I would list it as a con)I paid $699 for this laptop. And for the price I paid I'm thoroughly impressed. This computer performs like that of a $800-$1000 computer. Has enough RAM to execute all your programs, 1080p screen, a decent i5 processor and a pretty powerful graphics card for the price. Everyone always worries about needing an i7 processor for gaming but in reality if your graphics card is insufficient in this it's not then your processor won't give you any added benefit. What people don't realize is a i5 is more than sufficient in almost all cases to game if you have a good graphics card. In comparison to my i7 Lenovo there's really not much difference in performance rather the difference lies in the graphics card. About 4 years ago I paid $1100 for my Lenovo Y50 which had a NVIDIA GTX 860M and a i7 processor and I was looking for a cheap replacement for my laptop since it broke. But I was not really expecting much from the graphics card area especially at this low of a price. But surprisingly not only does it perform just as well it performs much better (new graphic card architecture and technology) for almost half the cost. At the time the 860m was a mid range graphics card for laptops. But back then the laptop version of graphics card (m) was not on par with it's desktop counterpart and in most cases only performed about 40-70% of what it's counterpart could do. But now with the new architecture and technology the laptop counterpart performs at 75-90% of it's desktop counterpart and actually is almost identical in performance since it's pretty much the same except for a few other tweaks but I digress. So the NVIDIA GTX 1050TI although a mid range chip performs so much better than mid range chips back in the day and especially for a laptop it packs a punch. Make sure when you get your laptop that it's the 1050 TI version and not just the plain 1050. The TI version packs a bit more of a punch which does make a difference. Because some people have complained and rated the computer poorly because they received a 1050 version and not the 1050TI.My only complaint is the plastic material in which it's made of vs the metal finish of my previous laptop. The plastic makes it feel cheap (well it is) but obviously it's more of an aesthetics thing than performance. And some complain about the hard drive space being insufficient. To be honest if you're using this computer for standard work the space will be more than sufficient enough for you, but if you game then it will run out fast but for the price you're paying it's quite a steal. Sure it's not a 1TB hard drive but it's a SSD which will increase the overall speed and performance of your computers load and boot times but also your games and overall SSDs are better for gaming. And there's an extra hard drive slot so you can always expand the hard drive manually either with a standard hdd if you're on a budget and need extra space or a 2.5 m sata II SSD if you want extra space with the continued faster performance. But you have to call Acer once you receive the product to get the HDD kit to add the extra storage. Aside from that the only other con is it can be loud when playing graphic heavy games but if you're alone and you have headphones on it won't bother you much. The fans although loud does keep the laptop cool despite the plastic.Overall the computer is a great purchase. Powerhouse performance for under $1000. Only difference between this laptop and others in the $1000 range is the hard drive space and sometimes the processor. As I said before the i5 processor is more than enough and you can manually add an extra HDD or SSD (just remember to call Acer to get the kit to expand storage it's free of charge) so technically there's not much difference maybe only in the material its made of.",2,0,3,2,2

395,"First off, the laptop runs really well and runs my Steam library pretty well, and is generally pretty snappy when navigating the desktop. However, the trackpad feels a little weird/slow to me (I'll probably get used to it soon), and if the screen is tilted at the wrong angle, the lighting and colors are way off. Other than that though, it's a solid laptop, definitely an upgrade from the Lenovo Y510P that has somehow made it with me all the way through college.Really the only reason this didn't get a 5 star review is because a week after I got the computer, my I kept on getting a crash loop to the BSOD telling my I had a MEMORY_MANAGEMENT error, and I couldn't use my computer for more than 30 seconds before it crashed again. I pulled out my old laptop (I'm currently writing this review on it) and looked up how to re-seat the RAM to see if it had been jostled loose or something, but even when I switched which slot it was in I kept on having crashes due to memory. LUCKILY, my boy Mohammed over at Dell support was on the phone with me while I was messing around in the chassis and Dell is sending me a new RAM stick free of charge. I'm a little bummed I won't be using my laptop for about a week but at least the customer support is good.I still would suggest getting this laptop.

Dell's technical support was pretty much useless and could not troubleshoot this KNOWN ISSUE. Unacceptable quality control from Dell. I'm not a computer wiz but did some heavy investigating to fix this. If you're having issues with crackling audio just update the audio drivers and it should fix it. To fix the fan issue you'll need to update the BIOS to most current available. Then go into the power plan settings and change from ""Dell"" to ""balanced"". Then go to advanced setting within that power plan and lower the ""maximum processor state"" to about 70-80% This has seemed to worked for me but you might want to tweek the settings to your liking. You might not even have to update the bios but might as well. So much better and has not affected the performance of the laptop. The fans were so damn loud I was about to return this laptop.

433,"This was an upgrade from an old Acer Chromebook and the difference in speed is very noticeable. I believed that the slower speed before was just because of the Internet lagging, but it's not.I bought this mainly as a big tablet that could also be used as a traditional notebook. I seldom use it as a notebook and either use tablet mode or dock it with a keyboard and big monitor.Although it does support the Play Store I found those versions of apps no more useful than the web version so I uninstalled the Play Store.One niggle is that there is a slightly raised ridge between the CTRL and Shift key which is strange and my fingers bump up against it with the occasional odd shortcut where I need to press both together. Hardly a deal breaker, but doesn't seem to be necessary.Another slight niggle is the placement of the headphone jack when using tablet portrait mode. To hold the computer easily I hold what would be the lower edge of the screen (the portion with the Samsung logo) with my right hand. That puts the headphone jack at the bottom which presses against my stomach if I don't actively hold it up. Flipping the tablet the other way (logo left) leaves too small a space for my right hand to hold on and the buttons sometimes get pushed by mistake as they're then facing down.Overall, this is a pretty awesome Chromebook. It's not really much more expensive than the cheaper options, but the speed, light weight, and tough build are way beyond.

440,"UPDATE 1: Yes, the ""R7 graphics"" on this chip is indeed the 512 GCN shaders version, not the weaker 384 GCN shader version found in the ""other"" A12. As a quick side-note, Lenovo seems to be one of the few ""built to last"" brands, I still have an old i3-3110m laptop from like 2012 and it still runs like a champ despite my heavy heavy use (usually had it on 10-14 hours a day) and accidentally dropping it a few times. I've really grown to like this brand over the years (trust).UPDATE 2: 12/11/2017 - It seems to handle the new ""Antorus the Burning Throne"" raid just fine (with lowered settings, of course), frame-rates are comparable to Tomb of Sargeras from what I saw. I did a few Antorus LFRs last week between my various alts and didn't have any issues, A12-9720P is definitely a solid chip for the price. By the way, coming up on 4 months of regular use and still running great. Like I said the only real noticeable issue is the relatively slow 5400 RPM hard drive, which makes loading in take a little longer, but that's about it.I'll chime in here for my fellow WoW players, recently picked up this VERY solid machine over at Best Buy. One day while randomly browsing their site, I noticed the price suddenly dropped to $320 out of nowhere. Recognizing the bargain, I went and bought it same day.Anyways, it plays WoW: Legion just fine on lowered settings. Since it's Labor day weekend and I've been bored, I've really put in some hours and ""put it through it's paces"" the last few days. Here's some rough averages of performance at the stock resolution (1366 x 768):15-45 fps... in ""new"" Dalaran45-80 fps... just flying around Broken Isles/open world35-50 fps... typical average while doing WQ's14-23 fps... in ""high clutter"" scenarios, heavy AoE, lots of players/mobs on screen, etc25-50 fps... in most Bg's, a little lower during ""high clutter"" encounters obviously (ex. in AV/IoC matches)17-25 fps... typical LFR boss or raid scenario25-55 fps... typical 5-man dungeonThe only real ""cons"" I can think of:- runs a little hot, I ran HWMonitor in the background during my WoW sessions and the CPU did get up to around 65-67C at times, although it MOSTLY hovers around 56-60C from what I've seen (mostly playing WoW, I can't speak for other games)- USB ports are located on the left side of the machine, just a minor inconvenience (no biggie)- still uses the older/slower 5400 RPM hard drive, again not a big deal for the low priceFor only $320 I'm very satisfied with my purchase, this machine is a great value in the sub-$400 laptop segment. Most laptops in this price segment can't play games at all, or if they do play games it's a slide-show (ex. Intel graphics).",1,4,1,3,2

My MacBook gets better FRPS than this machine does and it's 4 years old. The graphics card is junk and the screen is pixelated with outlined and bright around avatars and terrains. Do yourself a favor and save a little more cash and purchase a computer worth your hard earned money. The plastic casing and small fan also makes the fan run non-stop at running barely any low level game such as MineCraft, for example. I give this a - - - star actually as it took almost a whole minute to even open up a word document. Returning after trying to increase capabilities with no avail.

455,"I really enjoy this laptop. Probably my favorite owned laptop so far. It runs the Oculus Rift surprisingly well; I haven't had any problems running any VR games I've tried so far. Pleasantly surprised. If you're planning on going the most cost-effective way to get into VR, this is it.A couple of small things I've noticed, good and not-so-good:I love the way the keyboard feels. The material is nice, as well as the way the keys feel when pressed. It just feels nice to me.The housing between the keyboard and trackpad flexes rather easily. This isn't a problem, but it's also not a good thing.I enjoy the way the trackpad feels; it's a nice and smooth material.The overall look of the laptop in general is nice, in my opinion.Though this model supports a Core i5 processor, it's actually faster than a lot of available Core i7 processors, so if you're shopping based on processor power, you can pretty much count this as an i7 - unless you're shopping for hardcore gaming.The key shapes can be a little strange, but only for keys that aren't often used. Some, such as the numpad, look a little squished - rectangular.Overall, I was second-guessing my decision to buy this laptop while waiting for its arrival, but I have been consistently and pleasantly surprised with this machine so far. Very well worth the money.",2,0,3,2,2

458,"This is Day 2 and everything is great to me so far. I'm giving this 4 star just because I am struggling with increasing storage by mounting VHD. But once it's done, I am pretty sure I can give 5. Just like those who still eyeball and half-decided to buy this I was also suspisious that how good this tiny laptop can do. If you are not heavy user, i.e., use computers only for browsing, emailing, creating documents, watching video clips, this computer is right fit for you.Capability:I believe this computer is amazing for this price. Well I should remind you that I am not techie and I was looking for a new computer that can replace old one. And as soon as I got this mini laptop, I did a bit of experiment: runinng the two computers at my home. The older one has i5 3rd generation and this E200HA has Atom. First thing I did was that I played video on Youtube for the two laptops and the processing speed looks almost same to me. I also did for browsing, email, document, and all the regular stuff and I think netbook is highly capable. I don't write a code or do video editing and I can imagine doing these thing will require a lot more power and this loptop might not a good fit for that kinds of use. So those who gave 1 star or low rating on this computer did not look at the specs carefully.For battery life, the description says it can last more than 10 hours. It is kind of true, but it is highly depending on how you use the laptop. For example, simple browsing and creating documents can save battery and doesn't cosume much power so 10+hours is possible. However, if you watch Youtube video or listen to music a lot, the battery life can be more or less 6 hours. It is the nature of battery of course, I believe it is still great though.This laptop comes with Office 365 for 1 Year. This is great but those who use laptop for business use, you might want to purchase Office Suite by yourself. After the 1 year, your free-subscription will expire and if you want to use the same software you have to pay. So if you are heavy Word or Excel user, consider buying entire suite then you don't have to worry about expiration.Speaking of internal cam, don't expect much. When I turned it on, I was like someone put mosaic on my face saying SENSORED! The camera resolution is that blur and rough. If you skype on a regualr basis, I would suggest to replace with something else.I carried this around a bit of time, with laptop cover wrapped. Feels like I didn't hold anything and forgot that I was having on my hand and almomst dropped it. It is that ligthweight. Funny enough I was also looking at 15.6"" laptops and they were cheaper than other smaller laptops but most of them come with a lot of weight.Oh yes, I almost forgot to tell you that the sleep mode is amazing! Compared to my old one, this baby wakes up real fast from sleep (I would say 2 seconds) and I can use touchpad gestures with no problem (this was a big issue on my old guy and I sometimes had to restart it). Just like many computers, it takes a bit of time to get back to normal speed after sleep mode, but other than that this is great.Exteriors:The cosmetic color looks like a bit feminine on the screen, but the real one is more like champagne gold and not too shiny. The keyboard looks ok, but it doesn't come with backlit. This might also sound odd to you because when I first opened up the laptop, no simbol or icon on f3 and f4 keys, which is up and down button for backlit. Even though the Amazon description says that it is full-size keyboard, for 11"" laptop, some people might feel each key is small, especially those who have big hands. But I am pretty sure you will get used to the size.Minor thing: Caps Lock doesn't have a light so you might not notice when it is on or off. And also this is very my personal preference that I would love to have earphone jack on the left, rather than on right side. I have no idea ASUS placed charger jack on the left but not earphone jack? If you are southpaw, you can take a note while listening to music.Overall, this baby is great! But remind you that only relative to the price. You might not get a computer with the same spec or capability for twice much cost. If you want a powerful one that allows you to make movie, this is not for you. Those of you who want to have a portable, long-battery life, basic laptop, this is the one for you.",3,1,5,4,3

462,"Dear Chromebook Plus, where have you been all my life...That basically sums it up, if you want more meat and potatoes read along! First I always qualify my reviews with some background info. Im a portable computing nut. My current (and recently retired) list includes Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4, Dell Venue 11, Chuwi Hi12, Chuwi Hi 8, Chuwi Hi10 Plus, Samsung S2, HP Spectra 13"" 2in1, HP Spectre X2, Pavillion X2, etc. I've ping ponged all over the place trying to find the one to rule them all and Im coming to the conclusion it does not exist. My most recently retired machine was the Spectre X2 and the Chuwi Hi12, the Hi12 went to my daughter who basically uses it as a giant android tablet for netflix and simple games, The X2 went on ebay. The main issue with the X2 was weight, battery life, and charging system. When I do heavy lifting I always go for the Spectre laptop but I wanted something for when the laptop felt like overkill and the samsung S2 just wasn't up to the task. The X2 had mediocre battery life and only charged with the proprietary charger and also had a tendence to drain itself even while asleep if not plugged in at all times. More often then not this meant it got used less because I would forget to plug it in and it would be dead a day or two later, or I got tired of having to unplug it.I was never a Chromebook person, they seemeed too limited (yes I get thats the idea) but when I read about android being brought into the Chrome eco system it piqued my interest. The Flip was the first device of interest but the processor and screen were not what I wanted (I'm a lover of squarer aspect ratios). The Samsung piqued my interest again. Was it truly a tablet / hybrid device that was lightweight and portable enough for media consumption but also up to the task of occasional productivity work (excel, email, word documents)? Was it going to be powerful enough to be just enough when I don't want to get out my comparatively heavy and bulky laptop? Was it going to offer the all day battery life and ability to sleep without killing the battery nightly?I figured as a best buy elite member I have 45 days to find out! After about a week with the device though I can pretty much say its not going back. The screen is somehow one of the best I've used bar none, no need to qualify of ""at this price point"", this screen is exceptional. Bright, great uniformity, no bleed, and so so sharp. While it might seem a bit small by the measurement don't let that throw you off, the aspect ratio gives a much taller screen then you would have in a similar 16x9 laptop and it makes a massive improvement for my real world usage (reading PDFs, spreadsheets, etc.). Some people have complained about performance and I guess it's relative. So far I have found it to be completely acceptable given the price point, the battery life, and thermal envelope. Just tonight as I write this I have outlook (the android app) running, with spotify playing music in the background, a PDF open in Xodo (the android app not the chrome extension), chrome itself with 5 or 6 tabs open including gmail and facebook and the machine is still keeping up with my typing of this review. So for me that would be pretty typical use and its handled it swimmingly. The word processor app does respond a little slower with the android stuff in the background but everything still hums along at a decent pace.I also love that the machine is not just silent, it also runs cool. I've now had 4 Core M devices of various speeds and in tablets of various sizes, even when they run silent they can get uncomfortably warm (looking at you Surface Pro, Dell Venue, and X2). AGain its not the end of the world but its not ideal and once those chips start thermal throttling its debateable if you are actually getting your moneys worth from those chips. The chromebook here on other hand stays within room temperature with no signs of heat build up. Yes Core M is going to be faster but Chrome OS is also very very lightweight and google seems to be more focused on the Arm platform as the lead for Chrome OS. I could be completely wrong once they finally ship it but I suspect the Pro model with Core M is going to have a lower run time, run hotter, and for most people be negligible in actual end user experience.The joys of an always there stylus.. I have styluses for my Hi12, my X2, and my Surface Pros (or did while I had them still). In just about every previous instance they never got used. Its too easy to leave them behind or forget to toss them in your messenger bag, just by simply being there all the time I am literally 10000000x more likely to use the stylus for PDF markup and note annotations. I can go from typing a report on the keyboard to scribbling and highlighting with the stylus in less then 10 seconds. Yes the active stylus on those other devices are technically better but the point is moot when you have to remember to pack them up and find a place to put them. Its the Camera phone vs SLR argument, yes, the SLR always takes the better photos, but the best camera is the camera you always have with you. The best stylus is the one you can effortless have with you and thats what Samsung has delivered here. It is pressure sensitive, theres a modest amount of lag but it will only feel OFF if you are used to a higher end implementation like on the Surface. The physical ""feel"" of it is actually pretty good, theres a ""roughness"" to it that makes your strokes and writing feel more grounded. I do miss hover over like you get with the active stylus but again, if this is the compromise to have an always there stylus that doesn't have batteries for anyone but the most art focused buyer I think its the better compromise.Andoid Apps - I've yet to have any that didn't work. A few light mobile games (for testing I swear), e-mail and pdf apps, spotify, the key apps I use all just work. I've also read (but havent really examined it myself) that some developers such as Adobe are now actually designing their android apps with the expectation they will be running them on Chromebooks as well. Either way, Chrome OS is powerful for web work and adding the android apps really lets you fill in some blank spaces.Arm Performance - Anyone can push these chips to the breaking point but I don't think those demands will be typical of your average daily user. As I mentioned earlier, Core M is not power without comrpomise, at least all the devices I have tried it in. I would love for Samsung to prove me wrong but with ChromeOS the OP1 Chip seems to fall into the just good enough category. 4k Youtube, no problem. 60fps Youtube? occasionally a dropped frame but this probably come more down to the software then what the chip is capable of and I wouldnt be surprised if they tightened up support for higher frame rate video sooner then later.As a tablet - Possibly the best android tablet made yet. When folded into tablet mode the screen bezel (the bottom one) is actually a good size to give you a place to hold a nice grip without placing your hand on the screen. If you were to try and hold it by the other side (the top) the bezel is much thinner giving you less surface are to grip if attempting one handed usage. The keys will go clicky clackety when folded up but the machine is smart enough to ignore the keyboard when in tablet model so its inconsequential. All the android apps Ive used have worked well enough and its just the best thing ever to get a full blown Chrome OS browser in a tablet form factor.Build Quality - I think its gorgeous, I don't know why some folks think it looks cheap. The hinge is nice and tight, stays in place and everything just feels solid. The build quality is right up there with my Hp Spectre laptop just in a smaller footprint and at a significantly lower weight. If anything the light weight aspect of the laptop might give it a ""cheap feel"" but thats just our brains associating light weight with being cheap/empty/plastic. Keyboard is okay, no backlight (oh well) and the plastic keys are a bit cheap feeling especially as compared to the rest of the machine build. Two usb ports (type c) which can be charged on either round out the build. I also love that while they recommend the 30 watt charger it will essentialy take power from almost any source over those type C ports, if you go low enough it will still charge while sleeping but warn you that theres not enough current coming in to use and charge at the same time. The HP X2 was such a pain in this regard, despite charging over USB Type C they lock it down with DRM to only allow charging over THEIR charger. Not only are they over priced, it just means having to pack up ONE more additional adapter and one more thing to keep track of. With the chromebook, it might go slow as dirt, but I Can literally charge it with the most basic phone charger if thats all I've got with me and that does happen on occasion.Ive been using the machine more then I expected and for far heavier duties then I expected. It wont ever retire my Windows laptop entirely, some really heavy spreadsheets (VBA, lots of forumulas) and other system admin and SQL work just aren't suited for the Chromebook but I find myself using the Chromebook primarily and the laptop for those fringe uses in a ratio I honestly did not expect. Highly recomended and if you are concerned about keeping it try to ind one locally at a store such as Best Buy where you would have the option to do an exchange easily enough.",2,4,5,4,5
463,"My chromebook used to have limitations so I would need to use my husband's PC every once and a while. Now I add a few apps and its more functional and less expensive.

It's worked perfectly for all of those tasks, with no slowdown that I've noticed at any time. Battery life is excellent, with around 10 hours of actual use, and very good standby battery life.The only issues I've had are 1) keyboard - the keys are just a bit . . . different. Sometimes I think that I hit a key, but it doesn't register. This mostly happens when I'm typing longer emails or I'm not paying as much attention. If I focus on my typing, it's not an issue. 2) Fan - the CPU fan comes on even during low intensity tasks like web browsing. It's not very loud, but it is noticeable. I wish it were quieter, but it's really not a big deal. For how smooth everything runs, I gladly take the fan noise. And 3) the left USB port doesn't work with my wireless mouse. The right USB port works, and the left USB port works with everything else I've tried, including a USB hub and a thumb drive. Not sure what the issue is there, but I just use the right port.I would definitely buy it again, and I think it's a great device for the price.",3,3,3,2,4

I am impressed with the speed and screen brightness. I have watched movies and videos online without problems.I think I may buy one for my family to use. It is solid and does not have any loose or poorly fitting parts, but it is not as solidly built as a MacBook, but what can you expect for 1/5 fo the price. It is well worth the money I spent. If you have a kid or an older parent this should be a great computer for them because no Windows updates or virus software to fight or confuse the user. Be aware it is Google-centric and takes a google account to fully access all features.I have not tried games or anything like that on the computer but I am impressed with the machine compared to my daughter's Chromebook computer (3-4 years old), it's much snappier and the screen is much better in brightness and clarity.",2,2,5,4,2

482,"The purchase of a Surface laptop has been the most negative customer experience of my life. And I've dealt with banks and insurance companies.I bought the Laptop in early August and was happy at first, as it seemed like a good alternative to the MacBook / Pro. After about 45 days of light to no use, the laptop failed completely and tech support was unable to resolve, so refund / replacement was the only option.I thought about it and based on the news that had recently come out re Consumer Reports and the very high failure rate, I opted for refund, as my spidey sense told me this product had been rushed to market. I asked for a refund; as I was at 45 days vice 30, the request would have to be referred up for approval, response in 24-36 hours. Fine. A week goes by, nothing heard - I call, they advise 'your request has been denied.' Fine, I'll go with replacement, sell it on Kijiji, buy a MacBook. They send me ... a refurb. A highish end laptop fails after 45 days and MS believes a refurb is a fair trade. Now I'll have difficulty selling the laptop. I call back and say no way, not acceptable. They say 'just go in person into the store, they'll give you a brand new one.' The nearest store is 4 hours by car, can't do, have to do it via courier. They say 'We can't send a new laptop via courier, if you're genuinely not happy, ask for a refund'. I advise already tried, no success. They said, no, I'm looking at your file, a refund was never requested. So I waited for a week just to find out that first agent lied outright to me.Bottom line - I'm more than 2 weeks without a laptop, have spent in excess of 7 hours on the phone they consistently refuse to refer me to head office or any other level of customer support that might be able to authorize replacement with a new computer via courier. Apparently only Bill Gates himself could authorize such a thing, and he's busy. They have have ignored queries sent over email, Facebook and Twitter. This is what you can expect when your Surface fails.My sincere recommendation is buy a MacBook; the reliability is one thing, but the arrogance and ineffectiveness of MS customer service team is what makes me certain I WILL NEVER BUY A PIECE OF MS HARDWARE FOR ME OR MY FAMILY AGAIN. I've never had a major failure of an Apple desktop or laptop, when I've had issues with peripheral devices they have replaced even out of warranty.The product is not ready for market, the company is not willing to work with the poor suckers who got on early to try to find a good outcome.

484,i had this for about 7 months and its still going strong. it hasn't broke down on me yet. i mainly use it to browse the web i don't make youtube videos or do heavy task ect.. so this is perfect for me. and if i want to play a game i go on my consoles and do that. i use to browse on my tablet alot but since i got this bad boy this killed my beloved tablet. if you want a buy a laptop without spending 500-1000 dollars(im looking at you apple!) go for a chromebook and its incredibly fast once you turned it on it only takes less then 3-2 minutes to turned on.,2,2,5,4,2
485,"I debated with myself over the screen size; how small a screen could I live with? I also wanted it to be as light as possible. I opted for a larger screen, but I find that it's heavier than I wanted for my carry-around laptop so I could leave my bigger and very expensive MacBook Pro at home. In hindsight, I think I could live with a smaller screen, perhaps 12"".I also debated about the RAM and disk size. Disk size is actually far less important on a ChromeBook than it is on a Mac or PC. All your stuff is in the cloud. It only stores what you're working on at the moment on disk. You don't even have to copy files up/down. It does that in the background as you work with the Chrome apps like spreadsheets and documents. You don't even have to look at how much space is available on disk. I opted for 4GB RAM rather than 2GB, because the unit was still around $200. That's an unbelievable price compared to any Mac or PC.What I love about this ChromeBook is:- It sleeps and wakes instantly- Multiple people can log into their own accounts (with a Gmail login). I don't ever let anyone ""borrow"" my login.- Battery power seems to be infinite. As I use it, it lasts all day between charges.- It integrated with my Android phone so I don't have to type my password when I wake it. If the phone is connected on bluetooth and unlocked, you can just click your login photo. (This is optional.)- There's no system administration, no virus software needed.- Any work that I do on my Mac (or PC) are instantly available on the ChromeBook. No copying files to a USB, emailing to myself, or wondering where the latest version was. It's just there.- It's very secure. It's secure enough that I won't worry if it's lost or stolen. Everything is in the Google cloud. Nothing is stored on the device that can be recovered by a thief.For me, it's the perfect second/travel laptop. I still have my power user MacBook Pro for video and photo editing. This will do simple things like cropping photos, but it's not meant for heavy duty tasks. For 90% of people, this will do everything one needs.One note for Windows users is the one thing you'll have to learn is that everything is easier and simpler. It feels more like a smartphone with a big screen and full-size keyboard, exactly what I wanted.",2,2,4,4,2
486,"I'm very happy with my purchase. The laptop came quickly and was well packaged. I was looking for straightforward laptop that wouldn't break the bank.

I turned it into a vertically held tablet, with many pre-loaded tabs opened. I can enjoy the online media contents almost anywhere. When I can sit down in restaurant, I turn it into a laptop doing the assignment or office works. Its versatility is impressive. ASUS Chromebook Flip serve similar purposes, but 10.1"" screen is really too small, and 1200 x 800 resolution is too low for me.(By the way, I rarely use tent mode and stand mode, which are not as good as laptop mode in my opinion. Even so, I think convertible laptop is far more convenient than detachable laptop. Quick and intuitive to transform.)110%+ sRGB, 380+nits... the screen surpass most other laptop/tablet touchscreens (although the new iPad Pro do even better in true-tone and anti-glare). But just keep in mind, if you find yourself rarely use touchscreen, you may find matte finish screen is more attractive to you.Cons:Short key travel, exceptionally small ""backspace"" button, non-backlit keyboard, inefficient use of space above the keyboard, non-movie-friendly 3:2 screen... all these are minor issues to me.But 4GB RAM is a pain to me, especially I like to preload the contents when I have good Wifi access, that consume much RAM. The tab management and session management extensions can't help me much to save RAM.32GB storage is another pain to me that I am forced to delete some downloaded TED and Google Play Movies, and the Android game Final Fantasy Tactics.

495,"This is a great device for the price, but not without flaws.I still give it a 5 star review because, as with many of the video reviews out there, I've found it to be a really useful 2-in-1 to have around for games, taking notes, web operations etc. I make much more use out of the built-in pen than I thought I would, and the screen is simply superb.There is, however one oversight with their build of chromeos that will be insignificant to 90% of users, but a showstopper for the few people who want to plug in external MIDI devices for music production.PROS:Display : almost unusable for text at its native resolution, the display has a very wide viewing angle, good black levels ( to my eye ) and is very bright.Stylus pen : really handy, especially at hi-resolutions. Art programs are fun2-in-1 : At less than 2.5lb, feasible to use in tablet mode. Tent, vertical and other modes are handy.keyboard : decent travel, small backspace button, but you get used to that pretty quicklyAndroid on-board : some issues with some applications, but overall a good experience.Snappy performance: Not driven this too hard but performs well for regular use.CONS:- speakers are pretty meh, but I guess that's to be expected; I don't use it to listen to anything- Bluetooth connectivity seems iffy .. they might have not implemented everything perfectly- USB MIDI Does Not Work, period. I've spent a lot of email and phone time with them to convince them to check this out, but Chromeos does support MIDI over USB and the samsung engineers dropped the ball on this one. I've verified MIDI initializes and works on other chromeOS devices, but this one looks like it's missing the drivers or they simply didn't build in the midi libraries. MIDI fails to get past initialization on this device. I escalated the issue as far as I could and eventually convinced the support person to try to get the bug in front of an engineer, but we'll have to wait and see if they fix it. If they do, and make the 14 of us who actually want to use it for midi happy , I'll update this review.OK UPDATE ( 5/17/17 ) : still no fix for midi; samsung cs dropped the ticket, as far as I can tell. Still love the chromebook for other tasks, but I'm dropping a star cos they didn't build the os to spec... and I'm in a petty mood.",2,4,5,4,5

I have not noticed any screen glare (as one reviewer mentioned); I guess it depends on where you place the light. It is very fast.Missing, but not too bad1. No CD/DVD drive. That was necessary to keep the weight down. One can always use an external drive.2. There is no USB 2 port. This probably wont matter to most users, but when I try to install the driver for my 5.5-year-old HP LaserJet, it tells me that the printer cannot connect to a USB 3 port.ConsThe documentation is lacking some information. There are symbols on the function keys that I cant figure out, and the meanings are not included in the documentation.A method to boot from a USB flash drive is not described. I looked on line, and there is apparently a convoluted way to do it. I need this because I do regular image backups of my C drive to a USB drive. The backup software (ShadowProtect) makes a sector-by-sector backup of the entire C drive, including the operating system. If something goes wrong, I can restore the entire C drive to an earlier version. It even protects me from ransomware. To do a restore, I have to boot from a USB flash drive to a program that does the restore. My desktop has an ASUS motherboard. When I turn it on, if I press the DEL key, it takes me to the BIOS screen, where I can choose where to boot from. It would be nice if the LG offered such a simple method.

Really, there isn't much else in the category that comes close to this price.Unfortunately, the Touchpad drivers (which I discovered have been a WELL KNOWN ISSUE for several years) were complete junk, and all it took was one Windows update to basically make the thing useless. In total, I spent probably about 8 hours trying to find a solution, but every time I restarted after brief periods of success, the Touchpad was dead again.Oh, did I mention no touchscreen? Yep. Just junky. I would add that I also discovered that ASUS has a wide variety of screen problems in everything from their tablets to this laptop. If your screen cracks internally, you'll be on the hook for it, no warranty. Final note on the screen: I can't believe how cheap and plastick-y it is.

523,"I love, love, LOVE this laptop! Been using nearly every day for a couple months now. It's honestly been the best laptop I've ever owned and I've had several ""high end"" laptops in the past that had all kinds of bugs and wonky problems that couldn't be fixed or worked around. This, laptop, though, has out-performed even my best CPU's in functionality, power, and speed! I love that the laptop is VERY quick to start up.. No waiting 10 minutes for it to boot up - more like a minute and a half. Likewise, Windows homescreen is loaded within two minutes or less of signing in... my past laptops took at least five minutes - usually more - to get everything loaded so that I could actually use it. With this laptop, I can shut it and when I open it again, it pulls out of sleep mode instantly! My past laptops would just stay frozen in a sleep state if I ever closed the laptop while it was active/in use... which really sucked considering I have three kids under five that LOVE to shut my laptop when they walk by. Everything about the laptop is fast, really. It doesn't really get hot or overheated, which was another big problem I've had with past laptops... In fact, it's never even gotten warm enough on my lap for me to want to set it on a table or elsewhere from discomfort. It is extremely quiet and I really don't hear it running unless there is a CD/DVD in and the optical drive is in motion.The ONLY thing I have noticed that may potentially be a drawback is something that might not even be the laptop's fault. On multiple occasions, I've found that after 9 or 10PM the internet would suddenly stop working. I could see all kinds of wifi networks but it would always just say ""unable to connect"" to any of them regardless of right password and other devices working just fine on the same wifi network... However, I recently went into my settings and chose to more or less 'reset to default' my network settings and since then, haven't had a single problem. So, I wouldn't even consider that a notch against, considering that resetting that one thing has worked just fine... it was probably just a very random error that, clearly, was easily able to be fixed without any sort of outside help or costly service/repair fees. =)I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone who is a student, does office-type work from home, or just the occasional light user. I have not tried playing video games or anything of that sort (apart from old DOS/NES games you can find to play online), so I can't really say how well it would do for a gamer.",2,1,1,2,2

It is pretty fast with an 8th generation i5 and 12GB of memory, but I quickly replaced the hard drive with a much fast SSDup to 40x faster which is a recommended upgrade for whomever is tired of slow loading of windows and applications. Also, the ports are acceptable, with 2x USB type A and 1 type C, HDMI, card reader, and headphone jack, as well as a DVD drive.Now onto the less positive aspects. The battery life is mediocre, achieving a maximum of 5 hours with regular cases of 2:30 to 3 hours. That is one star deduction for me. The second deduction is from the screen. In 2018, all laptops should have a 1080p display; however, this laptop contains a 720p display, making everything appear huge. The tiny resolution packed into a large display is unacceptable, but it is what it is. The final star comes away from the keyboard, which is abhorrent. Cheap plastic and poor layout design combine to make a miserable typing experience.Ultimately, the Ideapad 320 is good for whomever wants the best laptop for his or her money, as long as they are willing to make many compromises.

I just wanted to use it for Quickin accounting and taxes not a big drag on the machine. Didn't like what I got but they would not take it back to look at it. Had a computer repair look at it found out it had a hard drive that was used and defective. also it came with a virus that would not let the airplane more turn off so the internet connect.

Mine works great still after those 4 months of heavy use. Now for sure it's not super cheap, that's why I think it would be great if Samsung could lower the retail price to about $349, then I really think it should be a no brainer.

570,"The Acer Aspire 1 is at the very most, average. There is nothing special about it. No special features, no amazing screen, everything is just okay. You might be able to justify this at $200 but you could defiantly find a better option for $200 (both used and new). The one thing that is decent is the speakers on the device, they are nice speakers, decent volume, and work fairly well. Saying that, that is probably the best thing I can say about the laptop. This computer seems to be mainly for online use. Even if this is true why not get something like a chrome book which optimizes the chrome browser (my personal day to day browser) much better. Some Chromebook models even have the Google Play Store. Surprisingly the build feels pretty sturdy, its no metal build but it feels pretty solid for $200. If not assumed before, gaming is a definite no for this laptop. Sure, web flash based games will work fine, but anything that requires anything slightly more than this will not work. Many application launchers for games will not even load. If you manage to get a game to load then you will instantly notice the hardware for the laptop. Yes, the hardware is okay for online use but will just not allow you to play any moderately, heavy game. Online use is pretty nice but opening any more than 10 tabs and you will get hit with a low ram message thanks to the very small 4gb of ram. Oh, and don't get me started on the 32gb of storage. Once you first set the computer you will have around 26gb of storage. After installing the new version of windows, downloading 2 or 3 small programs, and downloading 2 windows apps I had less than 5gb of storage. I am not giving this computer such a hard time, just because it cant play any games, but because it is not even good at what it is advertising to do- web browsing. Having all that said, the laptop is not terrible, it is just for a very small audience who need a little laptop to do very little web browsing. I am not part of that audience. You can't bash the laptop too much seeing that it is only $200 but if I were you, I would save my money to buy a more expensive laptop.P.S .. The battery lasts for a very long time on this laptop, but the few nice features are not enough to justify spending $200 on it.Acer Aspire 1, 14"" Full HD, Intel Celeron N3450, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage, Windows 10 Home, A114-31-C4HH",3,4,5,4,3

575,"Bought two of these for my teenage daughters for Christmas. They LOVE them! I did purchase an extra 1TB hard drive (also from Amazon of course) for each since they only come with 128GB SSD. They boot up in 10 seconds with the solid state drive which is why I purchased them. I see no reason to pay more for a larger SSD when I can easily add a 1TB drive for $50.I do wish Dell would follow other manufacturers and add a simple compartment on the bottom for upgrading the hard drive and RAM. Instead they cover one screw with the service tag requiring you to pierce it to take the bottom off. I find that to be a horrible business practice. Hey Dell, the 90's are over and people want to upgrade their laptops themselves without paying some overpriced ""service tech"". I guess the threat is that it will void the warranty. Well not in my state.And they wonder why they're losing market share.But even with that terrible corporate Big Brother mentality, it's not worth knocking off a whole star for it.",2,2,4,2,2

It works great for what I want, and it came at a killer price for the SSD and GPU inside. There were no major corners cut creating this machine, and I am a very satisfied buyer.Update: Recently I added an HDD in the extra 2.5 bay and it connected without a problem.

607,"8/31/2017 . . . I had to reset this HP to to factory settings today. Since this laptop was delivered July 19, 2017, I have encountered more and more slow responses, freezes, and blue screens of death. For Windows 10, it's a much lighter shade of blue than it used to be. Very frustrating. Wasted lots of time dealing with what the HP analysis tools reported as Windows 10 failures and problems with the partitions it created. Equipment checked out according to the HP analysis program, but it has been behaving suspiciously like the hard drive failure on the Dell this one replaced, I' beginning to discover there are no reliable hard drives or virtual drives. They WILL fail. HP seems to have problems accommodating Windows 10, as do ALL anti-virus programs. Nothing good for my computers on which I installed Windows 10.ORIGINAL REVIEW:My observations after 3 days:RUNS COOL! No overheating problems so far.Nice screen resolution with responsive touch screen.Camera seemed grainy, could have been lighting.Keyboard is OK (After all, it is a laptop)Touch pad is weird. Will require retraining your finger/thumb muscles. Although it does have left click and right click buttons, they are UNDERNEATH the touch pad, so at first, you'll occasionally click on the wrong thing. The cursor will move if you don't hit the buttons dead on. Not that bad, just different. I got used to it fairly quickly.Updates didn't take long . . . maybe an hour or two.6 GB RAM is adequate, but seemed odd to me. Why not build evenly? Max 16GB. Holds 2 X 8 GB memory sticks.DDR4 Memory. Description lists DDR4, but additional Information shows DDR3. It really is DDR4..The 2.4 GHz CPU speed is good, especially for a computer under $500.00; it is NOT slow.Haven't put much stress on the processor yet, so can't tell how it will perform in the long run.Used laptop without the charger for about 6 hours (mostly online w/ minimal disk use) before warning appeared that only 20% battery life remained.It runs Windows 10, and to create a recovery drive you must use a USB flash drive. It took up 8.6 GB on a 32 GB USB 2.0 drive. Probably need at least 16 GB drive to be safe. I used USB 2.0 rather than 3.0. It was cheap and took minutes, not hours. (May encounter errors first few attempts, but keep trying. Third time was a charm for me.) I still miss Windows 7 and computers that came with manuals & system CDs.The hard drive storage capacity of 1 TB is probably more than you can use before it eventually fails. The life of a USB drive is not that predictable either, but if only used for the recovery drive and written to only occasionally, it should outlast the hard drive by years.If computer develops problems, I'll revise this review.So far, I have been pleased with this purchase.",2,2,1,3,2

613,"I traded in my Laptop for credit towards my Samsung Chromebook Plus purchase. I also sold my Android Tablet after having the SCP for a couple days. A must for me, is it runs Android's Apps as well as my Android Tablets/Phones. Since Android Apps are optimized for the ARM processors, the Plus will run Android Apps better than Intel based Chromebooks, it's a trade off as they can handle ChromeOS better, but it is no slouch at ChromeOS. I really enjoy my SCP. I rarely if ever use my Desktop PC any more.IMHO you'll love it. Forget all this talk about people saying the keyboard and trackpad are subpar or lacking. There is a learning curve on the backspace, only because people are used to typing sloppy because it's usually a double sized key. I've compared the keyboard with other Chromebooks and I prefer it. The backlit is more a gimmick but I see its usefulness late night or early morning typing in bed, dark room. But I prefer the battery life. The trackpad is as good as any albeit smaller. The clicks work fine. Palm rejection sometimes fails, but it happens on every trackpad I've used. I particularly love using mine with my Choetech Multiport USB-c hub. Everything, HDMI, USB-C PD pass-through charges and anything I plug into the full size USB just works. Turn off the display or close it, and it switches to ""docked"" mode. Connected to HDMI it will extend the desktop or you can switch to mirror mode. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MREK4RSAs a 12"" tablet, it works fantastic too!

I purchased it as both a backup machine and to have some portability to work in warmer parts of my house during the winter months.I don't need a lot of bells and whistles on my laptops, and this Chromebook does everything I need it to. I am a writer and work all day on my computer; the keyboard is responsive enough without being oversensitive. I purchased a mouse to go with my Chromebook, but so far, I've just been using the trackpad, which is every bit as good as the one on my old Mac.The battery seems to last forever--I think I'm getting about eight hours out of mine, with multiple tabs open and streaming a few hours of video every day.The profile of the Chromebook is slim, and the machine feels very lightweight, yet it is substantial enough to hold on my lap without necessarily using a laptop desk.The screen's resolution is fine for my purposes, although the text size is smaller than what I've been used to, and I'm feeling a little eye strain. I need to see if I can adjust the settings to enlarge browser fonts. That said, most of my time of the Chromebook so far has been surfing the net; normally, I'd be on Google docs more, where presumably I could enlarge the font as needed. The glare-resistant screen makes it easy to work in front of a window. Also, this feature means I don't have to keep adjusting the screen angle when watching Netflix, for example, and changing my position on the sofa (I don't own a TV, so my computers are my entertainment). Fourteen inches seems to be the perfect size--anything smaller, and I think typing would be a challenge.This is a great machine for writing, Internet research and correspondence, and watching Netflix, Youtube, etc. The fanless model is of course quiet, but it still runs cool. I don't really miss a backlit keyboard (the only feature I wanted but couldn't get on my list of preferences), since I mostly type by touch anyway, and I never work in the complete dark. This is basically like having a faster, more comfortable tablet (ready to go in seconds) without having to install a bunch of apps (I'm fine running most things through my browser).

638,If your Surface device goes bad after warranty you are out of luck. I have a surface 3 that started having issues after 21 months of use. It was not abused. There is no repair service just a replacement charge of $320.00! This for a device that new was 500.00. This is completely absurd. If your Surface Book goes bad after 12 months it will be $600.00 to get it replaced and no option to get it repaired.Microsoft has reliability issues as documented by Consumers Report with 25 % of users having issues by the end of the second year. According to Consumers Reports this is much higher than other manufactures. My experience with Dell was much better for an out of warranty defect. They replaced a laptop that had a motherboard issue at no cost.My Surface 3 mini displayport does not work and it also has an issue with every USB device disconnecting then connecting again 5 times a minute when connected to the dock. This means it is continuously chirping unless I turn the sound down. I wonder what is next. Evidently Microsoft thinks this is normal.Microsoft Technical Support people have been prolite but totally useless offering no troubleshooting knowledge that I didnt already know.Out-of-warranty service fees by product United States (currency US-USD)Surface Pro 3 $599.00Surface 3 $310.00Surface 3 (LTE) $310.00Surface Pro 4 $450.00Surface Book $599.00Surface Studio $899.00Surface Laptop $450.00Surface Pro (latest) $450.00,1,2,3,2,4
639,"Laptop was working perfectly until, after two weeks, it simply died after playing a very non demanding game, kerbal space program. Temperatures were normal and the computer just randomly crashed and then could never post.In order to attempt to fix this on my own I went to take out the battery for 10 seconds. However, the battery casing is very poorly design--its placed inside the case!! Its not like the hp laptops where you can just swap it out easily by pushing a button. No, you have to remove a good 12 screws and take off the bottom panel just to remove the battery. I also sliced open my finger trying to undo all of the annoying latches without breaking the flimsy bottom panel. Oh, and by the way, it took me 10 minutes to realize that there was another screw hidden under the dumb factory seal label!!!! Very annoying and frustrating since it was very stealthily hidden. Lastly, you'll want to make sure you're very gentle when removing the case because it would be very easy to break off the little plastic latches that snap the bottom panel on.Currently put a support ticket into MSI and fortunately I'm within warranty, so I will update this depending on their responsiveness and ability to get my laptop working.So far im very disappointed, but I understand that electronics sometimes have flaws because of the laws of probability, and it may have actually been nvidia's or intel's fault, so I will revert this to 4 stars if MSI solves my problem. It would be 5 stars if the battery wasn't behind the bottom panel.UPDATE:MSI's RMA process was excellent. They did a very professional repair, it looks brand new and runs well. I was worried that they might mess up the thermal paste after putting in a new mobo, but it appears. Apparently there was a crack in the chassis that I did not even know about and they replaced and fixed it to without me even mentioning it! They've done right by me and I am impressed. I would give this 5 stars, but its not quite perfect due to the fact that the battery is on the inside and you have to remove 12 screws to get to hit. Besides that however this is an excellent product. I'll update if this dies again but MSI RMA service was fast and beyond expectation. Including shipping, receiving, them having to get new parts, and them fix it, it only took 2 weeks, and they rushed it so that I could get it before my trip. You won't be dissatisfied with the RMA service if you need it, so you can probably trust that MSI will do right by you. Thumbs up MSI. Killer deal for 899.",2,0,1,2,2

642,"For a 900 laptop this is great. It's fast and responsive. The screen isn't amazing but isn't horrible. They had to cut corners somewhere to offer a GTX 1060 laptop for 900. I have to knock off a star for two points though. It's a little too big. It's a 15 inch screen in a 17 inch laptop body. Keep that in mind when buying bags or laptop covers. You'll need one for a 17 inch laptop due to the size of the device.The second issue is Dells support assistant. This is one of the most horrible pieces of software and uninstalling it did not uninstall it. It basically tries to check the major systems of your computer whenever you reboot it or turn it on. The problem is it gives off false alerts. It thinks my fans are not working even though they are. Everytime it fails checking the fan it makes this horrible, loud sound. What's worse is because windows constantly updates my laptop will reboot every once in a while. This cause my laptop start screeching in the middle of the night.

You will probably NOT use it at its highest resolution, but it's got the clarity of working on a larger monitor. It's a tablet, and a fairly large one at that, so using it for drawing or as an e-reader for fullsize PDFs is easy. And those phone apps, those run on it too. Admittedly, the one drawback is that not all apps gracefully adjust to the larger screen.

670,"I had my original laptop (a Toshiba Satellite M505) since 2010 and it work well for everything I used it for. Then last month the second battery died along with the charger, so it was time to upgrade and after looking at all the options I choose the Dell Gaming laptop. I've had it for about a month now and so far, it has been a wonder to explore. The processing speed feels lightning quick compared to what I had and the quality of graphics is quite nice. I found the backlight for the keypad to be an amazing feature letting me type when its dark or hard to see well inside. I'm still learning about the other features and programs pre-installed but so far, they have shone usefulness (NVidia GeForce account, Xbox connection, Windows Defender, etc.). I should also talk about Windows 10, my original laptop started with Windows 7 and worked beautifully till they upgraded to Windows 10. It still ran well but certain programs and links to accounts simple got lost or could never connect. This laptop came with 10 so it has those bugs solved and most of the issues solved. Now for the big one: the gaming experience, was it good? Answer: yes, like I never have before! Playing on or offline, plugged-in or not gaming has never been so smooth for me. I joined steam ad installed Hollow Knight and its been a blast all the way. Battery life with last between 7 to 5 hours while gaming, and supposedly up to 15 hours when passive, unheard off for my previous laptop. As for the cons of this computer, not many but they are distinct. This laptop comes with a SD card slot, 3 USB ports, a LAN plug, and a HBMI port. It does have a DVD player, this can be a pro or con since there are no major moving parts inside to break or collect dust, but it means music discs ad movies will need to be on flash drives or you need to get a portable DVD player. The other major issue can be price, at 900 it can be pricey, though compared to other laptops with some of the same features its a good deal. So, in summary: Pros - great control, lightweight, good graphics, long battery life, useful built-in features and programs, solid-state hard drive with no moving parts, and strong compatibility with Windows 10. Cons - no DVD drive and soft keyboard along with a mid-range price tag. Overall, I have enjoyed the Dell experience and I have to say I love learning everything this computer has to offer.",1,0,1,2,2
671,"Since there are options for purchasing this laptop, this review is for the:""Acer Nitro 5 Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i5-7300HQ, GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 15.6"" Full HD, 8GB DDR4, 256GB SSD""Pros:- GPU is awesome (Currently playing Ni No Kuni 2 and Overwatch with no problems)- Heat, while there, is pretty minimal- Easy to access extra internal SSD/HDD slotCons:- Extra internal SSD/HDD slot technically works, but it will often disconnect the drive (think USB thumb drive being removed).When I first got the laptop and installed the extra internal hard drive, everything was working really well! This lasted until about February and the hard drive started having intermittent connection issues. At first I had an HDD in there and though that the moving parts were malfunctioning so I put an SSD in there instead. Didn't fix the issue. Then I thought that perhaps the laptop wasn't providing power to the drive after a while due to power saving options and I disabled that. Didn't fix the issue. Maybe I didn't secure the drive well enough and it was moving around too much, so I placed it in a stationary place and got lucky enough to have the drive be recognized again. The issue was solved for about a day but ultimately didn't fix the issue. I still have not been able to access my SSD for longer than a few hours once every few weeks (so far it's been 6 days since it last showed up on my laptop).To be fair, I haven't talked with customer support, so they could possibly save the situation. I think the bottom line is that I would expect that paying any amount of money over $500 would mean that hardware problems would be minimized.Overall:The weight, GPU, CPU, feel of the material, and look of this laptop are great. I want to like the laptop, but the inability to consistently use the extra internal hard drive lowers the score. As such, I'd say this laptop is OK and would probably be worth buying between $600 and $700. For transparency, I was able to purchase this at $699.99.",2,0,3,2,2

Also note that the solid state drives are 2 x 128 GB which i find unfortunate because I had wanted to add a larger solid state drive but found the slots were both taken. Therefore to upgrade the size of the solid state drive or drives you have to image your hardrive somewhere and copy it over to a new drive.

It's a little heavier than my ultrabook, which makes sense as the ultrabook is all plastic, and no touch screen. The screen on the Surface is sharp and beautiful. Setup only took a few minutes. I was disappointed when I tried to install Chrome though, and the the pre-installed OS wouldn't allow it. Luckily it did prompt me to switch to regular Windows 10, which I did. Since then I was able to install my normal software suite. The machine is incredibly fast and quiet. It doesn't heat up the way our old Lenovo did. The camera is very high quality as well, my wife's relatives have all commented that her video quality has improved alot. I really like having the touch screen, as I use a tablet daily. I found myself toughing other laptop screens out of habit, with nothing happening...My wife and I are very happy with this high quality laptop, it's a great upgrade to our older equipment.",1,2,3,2,4
721,"Using 3 generations of iMac at home for the last 12 years, I was reluctant to get a PC laptop. However, my work gave me a Dell with a solid state drive and i7 processor and in many ways, including its quick boot-up, it was more appealing than my iMac at home. Additionally, to get equal specs of solid state drive in a Mac, you have to spend double. So for a home laptop, the Acer Nitro 5, with an i5 processor, seemed like enough for my casual needs: writing on Google docs, surfing net, and watching movies on Netflix.Taking the Nitro out of the box, it looks with its 15.6-inch screen like a large laptop, big enough to be a desktop replacement. It is a very attractive laptop--modern, solid, and red-light keys that light up as you type. This is not a touch screen, but the touch-pad can give you a lot of the touch screen experience with the various two-finger swipes.Set-up was about 15 minutes as you enter your data into the Microsoft system. For me, the most desirable user experience is to do my work on Google Chrome, use Google Docs, and use all the same bookmarks from that browser. The Acer Nitro seems very capable and moves as quickly as my i7 Dell.A word about sound: On Netflix, the Dolby speaker sound is excellent; however, the sound was tinny on Spotify. Probably, the old jazz recording didn't sound well on Spotify. Probably better recordings would sound better though the speakers.For the aforementioned purposes, this Nitro i5 suits my purposes and is a very pleasant user experience. If you do more applications and need a workhorse for a laptop PC, I recommend an i7 processor with 512 GB SSD and 16 GB RAM, but for my purposes, the Nitro 5 has everything I need. Recommended.",2,0,3,2,2
722,"I bought this from amazon and I like it. However, I am not happy it is not getting the latest Chrome update right away. The pen is fine but it has significant lag when writing in OneNote. The lack of backlit keyboard is also a downer. I will be keeping it but I wish that for the $450 I paid for it, it was a little more polished.",2,4,5,4,5
723,"Pros:A lot of computer for the price!It has 2x m.2 SSDs (mine were 2 128GB) running in RAID 0 and a 1TB hard drive with space for one more. It came with 16GB DDR4 RAM and has two empty expansion slots, so upgrading is definitely a Plus. The backlight of the keyboard is decided into 4 zones and the color can be changed per zone. It comes with really good speakers and has an integrated subwoofer. The IPS display has extremely good viewing angles and can be set very brightly. The surface is rubberized and the touch pad has distinct buttons not integrated into the pad itself which is a huge plus! It can also be turned off and there are programmable keys with a profile switch. Also, connectivity and connections are aplenty.Not so Pros: The profile switching does not change the keyboard backlights correctly. When on Normal mode on battery, 1080P YouTube videos don't play correctly because the energy saving options are too aggressive. The subwoofer is a nice touch, but the engineers should have test d it with the keyboard installed. The keyboard rattles rather annoyingly when the bass beats. There is a second SATA drive bay empty but the couple cents cable for a second HDD is not included and it is outrageously priced on the secondary market. In Germany, there is one trader offering it for <7 (but in back order) and in the United States, you cannot find it for less than $19.99 and even up to almost $40 - since Acer does not offer it to the end consumer nor included it. For a premium product, this is not good. At last, why does it come with Win10 Home and not Win10 Pro? Encryption is a thing, you know?",2,0,1,0,1

726,"NEW REVIEW:I got one of these and it blew out on me in about 3 weeks. No idea why. Despite the comment below, I had it on a laptop cooler and I wasn't doing anything that would generate heat when it blew out. Research revealed that this was not a common problem with these machines, so I'm guessing I got one that just had something go wrong with it (not the first time that's ever happened to me).I sent it back to Amazon, got a refund and then bought another one. So far so good. I liked the laptop enough to warrant purchasing another one, so I thought it only fair that I revise my rating. Providing this one doesn't blow out on me in a couple of weeks, I see no reason not to rate it 5-stars (original rating had been 3-stars).It's an amazing little machine that runs everything I throw at it.OLD REVIEW:A great laptop, but it stopped working completely after about three and a half weeks of use. It shut down while I was doing light work (nothing that would generate any major heat) and then never came on again. Had it kept working, I would have probably thought it was the best laptop I ever owned, but given that it gave out on me after such a short time, I'm not sure I can recommend it. I'm giving it three stars because when it did work, it worked great. I was able to play ""The Witcher 3"" on ultra video settings with a very good frame rate (even though I usually knocked it down to high).There's no guarantee that my experience will be the same as yours though. No idea why mine stopped working. Good luck with your purchase. I had to return mine.",1,0,1,2,2

I wouldn't try off-battery gaming, since the laptop will use the Intell Graphics card rather than the GTX to save battery life.As a standard laptop, it's slightly larger than some, but will last for about four hours without battery (using it for four hours straight).There is no trade off here, other than the CPU having no fans for cooling.

The fingerprint sensor makes logging in a breeze and it stays up from the scan nearly instantly. Occasionally there is a little lag but nothing to bad.

You'll get significantly better performance with an i7. You'll run games nicely enough, but spend a little more and you'll be very satisfied.

It comes with 8 gb RAM expandable to 16 gb through the memory door. You can do it yourself and it doesnt take long. There is a slit-type fingerprint scanner for security. The display is good. The touch pad has smart gestures, although you can turn them off. Its responsive enough to use for occasional graphics work. Im used to Toshiba laptops, have used them for a lot of simple graphics manipulation, sizing photos and correcting minor flaws, and this is as good in that respect. For extensive graphics use, most people would get a larger, clearer monitor, but for a laptop and occasional graphics use, this is more than adequate. The keyboard layout has the number pad to the right and the touch pad centered under the letter area. The laptop uses Windows 10, 64-bit version, and has appealing security and network features such as the ability to wake the computer remotely. I tend to worry about things like that, myself, but remote log-in can be important for business use. Amazingly for something this thin, the laptop has a DVD drive. Its nearly as thin as one without one. I was surprised and impressed. Its extremely well-designed, both in terms of looks and basic functionality. If youre shopping for a thin, light laptop for home office use, travel or commuting, that looks great, performs well and feels very solid, Id recommend this one.

There was an incredible buzzing noise whenever I scroll down/up. I'm not sure if it was coming from the fan or something, but it sounded like it'd be a serious problem in a foreseeable future. I've returned it. The second one came today. Product box was already opened (black tape with ASUS logo on it was cut) and it was really disappointing. Still, I kept going to see if it were acceptable or not. There were fingerprints everywhere, a scratch on the screen and another one on the case. Annoying white dust stuck between the bottom side of the screen and the bezel (I don't know how did they manage to do that because there is almost no even any space between the screen and the bezel!). And lastly, Windows 10 installing guide was different than the first one. It was weird/clipped and made me uncomfortable. Frustrated, I've returned that too and got a refund.

777,"I bought this notebook while my daughter was in USA. Since I live in Brazil, she brought it to me 2 weeks ago. I'm not a gamer, I'm a software developer, so I need a fast machine to do my daily work, and gamers notebooks usually fits this requirement. I was an ASUS fan back in the 90's, when I used to assembly desktop machines with parts from different brands. ASUS was my preferred brand for the motherboards in that time, so I supposed that ASUS notebooks would provide the same quality that I was used to, back in those days. Well, it seems that my expectations was too high. The machine is fast, of course, but I faced two problems that I would like to share: When you ""click"" in the touchpad, it is like there is something loose inside that hits the plastic chassis mostly where you stand your wrist, causing an weird sensation. The other problem is a ""high frequency"" noise coming from the notebook when the CPU is under some load. I searched the online forums, and this sound seems to be pretty common in ASUS notebooks, and they call it ""coil whine"" sound. It seems to be harmless, but very annoying. The loose touchpad also seems to be common for those notebooks. Unfortunately, ASUS warranty does not cover Brazil, so seems that I'll have to live with those problems. They are not showstoppers, but they should not exist at all in a quality product. Another problem was regarding the (mostly useless) ASUS support. I replaced the original SSD with a (higher capacity) Samsung EVO 970, meaning that I had to do a fresh install of Windows 10. I downloaded all the drivers from ASUS site, but I wasn't able to install the touchpad driver. In the end of the install, it always raised an error. I contacted ASUS support by chat, and they gave me all kind of useless answers, like installing ASUS live, send it to RMA (in my case, this would not be possible), etc. I was sure that there was no hardware problem, since the touchpad worked fine in the bios setup screen, and also worked fine in the pre-installed Windows on the original SSD. It took me more than a day digging into forums, etc until I finally found that I had to install the Intel I/O driver before installing the Precision touchpad driver. This wasn't mentioned anywhere. This solved the problem, but I wonder how ASUS support missed this information! So, I wonder if buying an ASUS notebook was the best choice...",2,0,1,0,2

781,"UPDATE: ASUS asked me to return the laptop for keyboard repairs. Turns out there is no option to purchase onsite warranty or extended warranty here in the US. The whole process could take 2-3 weeks. So I returned the laptop back to amazon. The return process was swift and easy. Watch out for the limited one year warranty, there is no way to extend that. I'd suggest looking at the DELL G3 and G5 which was just released which is way better at the same price.Delivery: Very prompt delivery. Came in a Amazon box. The ASUS box inside had two puncture marks (I've attached the photos). Thankfully the deeper puncture mark missed the laptop and went through the cardboard skirting that holds the laptop in place inside its box. The ASUS Laptop box was also placed upside down. If the whole package was kept on the floor the only thing between the ground and the laptop were two sheets of cardboard. All the air filled cushioning material was on the wrong side. It's lucky that USPS handled it carefully and nothing broke on the outside. Still a little worried about the effect that might have had on the HDD.About the laptop:This was just launched like 3 weeks before it was ordered. So I was skeptical about the initial hiccups new range of laptops come with.Pros:1. The keyboard keystrokes are sublime. And its a full sized keyboard with the NumPad. The red backlight comes in three brightness levels and an option to turn it off. (There are issues with the backlight which I've covered in the latter portion which I hope is just a defect in this particular laptop and not the whole range)2. The processor is pretty good. Almost on par with and in some ways better than the i7-7700HQ for anyone confused between the two.3. The graphics card is not that great but for the price of $699 it is sufficiently good.4. The cooling fans are very very effective but insanely noisy. Played Battlefield 3 on ultra settings and after a while the middle section of the keyboard was pretty warm/hot but the WASD area was almost at room temperature. You could feel the negative air pressure pulling air into the fan through the keys in that general area (No Idea if this is a good thing or bad)5. The trackpad has a nice feel to it but a slightly noisy click.6. The speakers are really good!7. Not a lot of preinstalled bloatware.Cons:1. The screen is FHD but just not that good. Like really bad viewing angles. Previously had a 14"" TN screen that I could live with, but on this bigger screen light quantity varies a lot from the top the bottom of the screen.2. The SSHD is slow and isn't the most silent. It makes tiny clunking noises.3. Battery life is really bad. 2-3 hours is the most you can get out of this even on battery saver.4. The fans are really noisy!Stuff that might just be wrong with the device I received and not necessarily the product line:1. The backlight flickers when it is kept at the lowest brightness level. I've attached a video of it too. The flickering you see is not due to the camera but the backlights on the keyboard.2. A portion of the F9 key is not lit up. a part of the LEDs beneath the key are not lighting up.I guess I'll have to contact ASUS regarding this. Really not pleased about this.Overall it is a pretty good laptop for the cost. Another one in this range that might be as durable as this one is DELL insprion 15 5000 gaming.

Have two issues with build (i) keyboard keys are red, and for a color blind person like me it all blends; and (ii) a little bit bulky but that's what's expected for a gaming rig so it is an issue, but not one to be mad about.System came as advertised, I read before the order that there were some issues with the specs not matching up to as described on the website but it was legit.

This one is suppose to be faster, have more ram, faster processer, etc. etc. I found it much slower then my reg. one that is in the shop getting fixed. (and my reg. one is suppose to only half as fast as this one). I also suffer from a neurological problem where my muscles get very very weak the more i use them, so in typing I find the keyboard on this computer harder to push down then my other one. The screen is ok,, but not near as vivid. So maybe I""m just bias towards my old laptop, but i feel this one is not as nice a system as my older one is. As soon as my older one is out of the shop (it only needed a new fan) - I will go back to it and just store this one for another time when it will be needed.",2,2,1,2,1

797,This last 2 months biggest piece of crap!!! It sat on my desk most of the time and I needed it for a weekend trip so I unplugged it and took it with me. After unplugging it 4 or 5 times the inside adapter for the battery charging broke. When I contacted Dell they said it wasn't covered in warranty it was wear and tear.... and I would have to pay to replace it. What?!?

It's frustrating to say the least and I regret the purchase.",1,0,1,2,2
802,If a beautiful screen and great build are all you're looking for then you might put up with its other issues but there's too many trade offs for the price. VLC for either Chrome or Android wouldn't playback most of my movies. In tablet mode the keyboard would still randomly let keystrokes get entered. OK Google detection was broken. I literally returned it within 48hrs. If the m3 version has a backlit keyboard and they sort out the buggy software I may give it a shot. I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this Chromebook but it was literally the biggest disappointment in an electronics purchase I've had in years...,2,4,5,4,5

804,"I have been using this laptop for the past few weeks and have nothing but great things to say about it!! For the past several years, I have been using an iMAC desktop, but there were times I wished I had a laptop, so I wouldn't be tied to my desk.The Dell Inspiron has been great. The laptop is very thin and lightweight. Very sleek looking and easy to throw in a carry all bag or computer sleeve and run out the door. Set up was very easy and took about 20 minutes. Following the prompts made it basically effortless to get up and running. One of the features that is new, is the facial recognition to sign in. User looks into the screen and the computer picks up on features to sign them in. You can also have a backup passcode to enter if your face is not recognized. This is nice if you are the main user but have someone else in the household that would occasionally use the laptop.The battery life has been good. It has been disconnected for about 4-5 hours, laptop was connected to wireless internet and Microsoft running and still the laptop had battery to give before it was plugged back in. The bottom of the computer did get pretty warm on my lap while I was resting it there work on it. I eventually moved the la top to the coffee table because of the heat. Once connected back to the power source, the battery charges very quickly. It was back up to 100% power in no time. That is great if your run your battery low and don't have time to sit and wait for a recharge.Some of the features that took some time to get a hang of, but I ended up loving, were the touchpad and the touchscreen. The touchpad is very sensitive. While typing if you hover close enough to the touch pad it will move the mouse and change your screen. For the first few days that was very frustrating, but once I figured out how to adjust my hands to stay off the pad, it has not happened very much, if at all. The sensitive touch pad is actually something I like now that that I have learned how to control and navigate with it. I can quickly jump from screen to screen or to text within a document.The other new addition to the laptop that I have not had previously is the touchscreen option. That is great!! Having the ability to move around on the screen by touching the actual screen is outstanding. You can use the touchscreen feature while in laptop mode or flip the screen over and have in tablet mode. It takes virtually 1 second to transition the laptop to a tablet.For having a laptop that is for personal use, mostly email, online, and Microsoft office this laptop is perfect. It is fast, lightweight and easy to use. There are so many features that we haven't even touched on yet but I can't imagine that I won't also like those once I get to needing them. I am by no means a computer person or guru but I have been working on a computer for many years and this is by far one of the best laptops I have used!!Very happy with this product and recommend it highly.",1,2,3,2,4

810,"I have been looking for a budget gaming laptop so that I could play a couple of my games, since my old laptop can't really play games.After reading some reviews on amazon and some articles about gaming laptops, I decided to go with this laptop.When using the laptop for hours the keypad tends to get warm but it doesn't get hot to where it burns your fingers.I can agree that the audio isn't as great as my asus laptop. It sounds like it the voices are cracking when at high volume, but at low volume (roughly between 15-30) it sounds a lot better with the game audio adjustments.I bought the 1050 4gb and the graphics are great very high def and smooth. I can play all of my games at high settings. I play mostly RPGs so it is great to have smooth graphics.When running windows programs the texts can be blurry but going on the web and playing games everything is all HD.The battery life is great when using the web or watching movies, but when it comes to gaming it could honestly use some work. It would last about 1 hour to 1 and 1/2 hours when playing a game that requires a lot of power.Overall I'm happy with my purchase, and when I added an extra 8gb RAM everything got faster when loading and the battery life was boosted a bit.",1,0,1,2,2

814,"Have had mine about 4 months now and we love it. Perfect for web browsing, email, limited writing, reading e-books.Pros: Thin form, nice brushed metal case, LOVE the dual function as tablet and laptop. Most Android apps work well on it. I like the stylus even though I don't use it that much. Beautiful display. Full-size keyboard. Charges quickly and battery lasts a couple days. Boots up in seconds. I was a bit concerned I'd be bothered by limitations of Chrome OS. Hasn't bothered me a bit. Especially with pretty much full Android functionality, there's not much you can't do. It's fast. I've never noticed any lagging and I'm pretty sensitive to that. I like the sync'ing between the Chromebook and Chrome on my desktop.Cons: The keyboard is pretty cheap feeling. Wouldn't want to write a novel on it. Occasional hiccup where I can't type at all--need to reboot then, which takes all of 20 seconds and that always resolves it. Hinges are a bit sticky/creaky--but better that than loose. The file system takes some getting used to. Android apps can't access the SD card--supposedly that will eventually be fixed.Conclusion: Double-plus good. Don't even consider a Windows 10 laptop unless you have absolutely no choice.",2,4,5,4,5

831,"Update May 2018: The laptop is pretty solid minus the failing drive mine shipped with. There was a mix up when the early review model was shipped to me so I received the wrong storage option. Asus support never responded to me despite multiple attempts to contact.TL;DR.. if you avoid the Single 1TB Hybrid Drive option, and utilize Amazon's return policy instead of ASUS support, it is a pretty solid gaming laptop. I swapped out the 1 TB Hybrid drive and problems went away. It is a very quick laptop with great graphic and CPU performance for the price.-----Things are not starting out well with this laptop. This is a new laptop so I do want to give ASUS a chance to address this. I will update this review as things develop.First of all, I was shipped the single 1TB spinning disk option (with the 8GB SSD cache built in, a.k.a the Seagate FireCuda 1TB), not the 256 SSD + 1TB HDD option I was supposed to review.I went to install some familiar games to run some benchmarks. I go away for a couple hours while the downloads run and come back to the machine crawling very slowly. I'm wondering why the download is going so slow and windows seems very sluggish, so I open up the task manager and find the hard drive is working really hard to keep up with a 2.5MB/second download. This is not at all normal behavior. I've attached a screen shot.I download Seagate's SeaTools utility and read the hard drive's diagnostic counters (SMART stats). SMART comes back clean (surprisingly), but the thing fails to complete even the short self-test, which clearly shows a failing drive. Another screenshot of that. A reboot changed nothing.Updated: Three contacts with ASUS support so far without any resolution.",2,0,1,0,2

836,"1 star is a bad rating and should only be reserved for garbage. I am sorry to say that is exactly what Dell is. This is the first product I have bought from them and within 6 months of purchase, the speakers/audio card is defective. After contacting servicing and sending the product into the repair center they return the product without testing the speakers which continue to show the defect. Throughout the servicing process, there was no contact other than updates and those were too few only mentioning what was done such as arrival, diagnosis, and shipping, Nothing was known about their diagnosis until after the shipping.This should tell you that Dell is absolute trash and if you value your money pay for another product. The laptop seems incredible boasting the new GPU, SSD/HDD hybrid, I7, and 16 GB RAM. These are all a scapegoat for a shoddy product masquerading as an incredible deal. If you value your money at all buy anything else. Prior to this, I had an HP laptop that lasted over 6 years and is still running, and most laptops should not have this problem within 6 months of purchase.",1,0,1,2,2

Not a very good typing experience for someone like me that types all day long. If you are just doing casual work on the machine, then it's ok. Chrome is a great operating system but still very limited in what it can do. There's been a lot of talk about running Android apps now on the Chromebooks, but I would give the current implementation a C+. You can load the Android apps. Some work better than others and most frustratingly, some do not operate at full screen, only the same size as on your phone. Arrgghhh.

I can do all kinds of nifty things with more than one window open. I was originally pretty disappointed that it wouldn't support Microsoft Word, but google Docs has certainly fulfilled my needs. Oh the Battery life is also amazing. I charge it at night... most nights... and it lasts all day while I study away.

848,"I bought this since all of my apple products won't run Linux, and well I'm tired of Apple.Overall the build quality is nice for a $750 laptop. The i5 processor is fast enough to get things done (writing software/browsing/minor video editing). 8gb of ram is ""ok"", but it'd be lovely to have 16gb even if the cost was a bit more as the ram is not upgradable. The SSD is decent but there are faster drives out there, again for the price point not a big deal. 99% of your average consumers won't notice the IO difference between the onboard SSD and something more high end.The reason why I gave it only 4 stars was due to the fact I've had to return this model twice due to screen artifacts and bleeding. I'm not sure if I got 2 bad units in a 6 month span, but either way it's annoying. It's not extremely noticeable but when you're writing code, it can obscure your view.If the screen issues could be resolved, I'd buy another one in a second. Sadly, I'm going to look at other Linux-compatible laptops.Oh and Ps... if you are running Linux a couple of things.1.) Go for Mint, Ubuntu, or Debian as it is supported out of the box2.)

I just use it to buy more stuff I don't need on Amazon and write papers in Word. Maybe watch the occasional video. Pretty simple use so I don't know how it would handle a bigger workload.The extra hard drive is cool. Again I don't know much about computers so I just kinda have it but I'm sure if I ever wanted to download large files or anything that would be super convenient.The biometrics part is nice. You can only have one registered print so it has to be the same finger in the same spot every time which is probably my biggest complaint. I might be spoiled because my phone has I think 5 registered fingerprints so I can be in a different position or use my left hand if I want, where on this computer I can't.But I definitely like it.

My main gripe so far for basic office use are: 1. while it charges super fast and perhaps that is the setting which will kill my battery, I don't think I ever would have gotten 8 hours of full work time on it, and 2. the power off button is right next to the delete key...I can not tell you how many times I have hit it by accident and switched off my computer unintentionally. However, I have not ""yet"" lost any valuable work as perhaps it is only putting the computer to sleep when I hit that the first time thereby saving my work.

I would highly recommend it for anyone that doesn't need a dedicated graphics card (photo/video editing, gaming) as the battery life is phenomenal.I try to charge it at around 40% and not past 80% to preserve battery life, so I only get about 5-6 hours SOT, but I'm only using 40% of the battery at a time. It charges quickly, 30 minutes or less to get that 40%, and I almost never turn it off, I just let it sleep. I can let it sleep for a couple days and if it drops 1% in that time I'm surprised.The screen angle is a bit annoying, I wish it would go back a bit further (15 degrees more would be great), but its light and it feels durable (not as nice as a macbook, but its half the price).I have had issues sometimes with the trackpad not responding properly, but I believe thats due to Ubuntu. It works wonderfully in Windows, I never have any issues typing in Windows and my hand usually rests on the trackpad, which caused problems with my previous laptop.The USB C is amazing for me, as my phone is USB C, it really makes life easy. Not as big of a plus if you don't have other usb c devices. The mini HDMI is annoying, I still haven't purchased any miniHDMI to HDMI cables.The speakers are in a terrible spot, underneath the laptop, and they're pretty underpowered. Again, in my mind, that would fall under a media machine, which this is not, so its not a deal breaker for me.My girlfriend purchased the 8th gen. It has a slightly more powerful processer, but less battery life. It still lasts a very long time, and she has no complaints.All in all, I love my laptop. Its unbelievably light, and the battery is awesome, and its more than quick enough for anything I use it for, as I don't do anything graphically intensive.",3,3,3,2,4

869,"My 48 hours review of the New Microsoft Surface Laptop with my Pros and Cons...I originally planned on ordering my PC from Amazon but I ended up placing my order directly through the Microsoft Store and doing an in-store pick up. I was able to receive a 10% student discount so it made the price lower than anywhere else.I went with the Graphite Gold i5, 8gb, 256 - this configuration meets all of my needs since I don't do any gaming or do I run any heavy programs. My use will be web browsing, school and business use with Office 365, some light photoshop or camtasia every now and again, and streaming video so this compute meets all of my needs. I upgraded it to 10 Pro right out of the box since I don't want to be limited to Windows Store Apps only.The Alcantara wrapping is OK, I can see it getting very dirty and showing wear and aging at the 6 month mark, Microsoft says to just keep it clean by regularly wiping it downs using a damp lint free cloth. I personally will have this laptop connected to a docking station while at home and use a wireless keyboard and mouse along with a bigger monitor connected via hdmi from the mini display port so I am not that concern with it the Alcantara getting dirty and faded. I will only type on it directly when I am at school and I usually take hand written notes on legal pads so I'll make sure to keep it clean. Also with the Microsoft Complete for Surface Laptop you can get 2 yrs of coverage from damage and issues.Pros ++ The touch screen is excellent! The touch screen is really great and has works flawlessly so far.+ The screen and the resolution is excellent, the picture quality and brightness is the best of any computer I have owned and it should be as this has the highest resolution screen.+ The built quality feels premium and heavy with the aluminum casing.+ The Windows Hello Facial Recognition was a big selling point for me, it works great and you will have hands free sign-in.+ The speeds seems faster than the 15"" laptop I replaced which also had an i5 from an early generation at 3.2. That PC is still working perfectly I just wanted a new laptop.+ The keyboard is nice with 4 adjustable black light settings (off, low, med, high) and feel while typing is so quality and smooth.Cons -- The color could have been more vibrant with a bit more pop, I think I would have like the cobalt blue color better. But it is still a nice color.- The touch track pad sucks! Maybe I have to make some adjustments to it but so far it's too sensitive and responsive doing other things on its own I did not want.- Cost, it's a bit on the higher end. It is a premium product without a doubt so I guess you have to pay a little extra for that Microsoft quality. It's the same price as the 13"" Macbook Pro which I considered but ruled out because I prefer Windows.Another beautiful option to consider and the one I had to think about for a few weeks is the new HP SPECTER x360. That is a gorgeous computer with higher specifications for the same price. You can get a i7 a better graphics card and the same premium look and feel of quality with an aluminum body. The main reasons I decided on the Surface Laptop was the Windows Hello Face Recognition.",1,2,3,2,4

First, it did not handle video well at all: video apps, particularly those from tv/cable sources, buffered for several minutes, then ran OK for 15 minutes, then buffered again, etc. Intolerable, especially since my $250 less expensive Acer R11 handled the same v with NO video problem. Decreasing to 720p did not solve this problem. Second, the microsd card was not recognized, no matter what fix I tried from web sources. Third, Kindle books did not fill the screen in portrait mode, only in landscape mode. Plus no backlit keyboard at this price? Don't buy this inferior product. I am still searching for a Chromebook with a display larger than 11.6 inches, backlit keyboard, 1080p or above, that handles video well, and I am willing to spend $450, but apparently no such machine exists.",2,4,5,4,5

903,"I've had this just a few days but have been trying to put it through its paces. I struggled between this and the Asus Flip C302A. Ultimately, the 3:2 size and stylus won me over, and a slightly better price. I decided early against the Pro because it's overpriced, still has purported bugs, and honestly I prefer the silver. I also waffled on getting a small Windows 2 in 1, but they are heavier and noisier. I'm VERY pleased so far. There's plenty of power to do what I need.Having loved my Android tablets for 4-5 years now, even if tablets are on the way out, I thought it would be hard have a laptop-esque device, but the convertible form is heaven. Just heaven. And stunning screen (I have it set far less brighter and the battery lasts FOREVER). Things others critique: 1) the trackpad is fine, geeze, no problem with it 2) the keyboard is fine and I figure even if you're used to full size, which this really is close to, you will adjust if you have to write a 20 page report.There is a bit of a learning curve using apps here compared to tablets (everything hasn't always been translated perfectly), but the apps I use the most work fine. I'm a light to moderate user and stick to the basics most times. There's simply A LOT this device can do and will only get better with updates, which should come fast and easy compared to a tablet.The weight is awesome. Was worried since it's twice my tablet, but it's still ultra portable. Quiet. Boots fast. Shuts down fast. Looks fantastic. Feels fantastic.

907,"Got super excited about buying the new Surface laptop and the excitement pretty much ended as soon as I took it out if the box. I won't talk about the lack of USB-C ports, or the longevity of the Alacantara surface material because Tech. websites cover that in detail. I will give you my personal everyday user experience:So opening the laptop is not easy, by easy I mean i should not be struggling to open the screen when I supposedly bought the laptop with the ebst design in the market. There is no hinge, or a little gap for you to slide your thumb in to open the damn thing.The laptop moves around a lot when placed on even slightly polished surfaces. I was at a local coffee shop and it kept moving as I was typing.I could not even connect to the WiFi at the coffee shop. I clicked on the network and it kept trying to connect me for the next 5min. Finally, after looking up an article about this problem with Surface laptop on my Iphone, I had to RESET my Wifi settings on my new laptop for it to work. It's 2017, and this is not acceptable for a machine this expensive or any tech. product no matter the cost.The screen colors are not something I am familiar with. I haven't looked too much in to that but the display has a very unfamiliar shade of white that I am not used to.The laptop is not Up-gradable, meaning 2-3 years in to the future when you decide to upgrade the RAM or storage, you can't. That's a big setback because laptops slow down with time and not being able to upgrade it will cost you well A NEW LAPTOP.So it's been about 2 days since I've had this and the day I started using it, in about 3 hours I had already ordered a Refurbished Macbook Pro, 13"" Oct 2016 release date(Same Price). Now, I am just waiting for that lovely piece of machinery to show up at the Apple store so I can return this sad attempt at recreating the Macbook by my neighbors in Seattle.",0,2,3,2,4

The battery barely runs for 3.5 hours if you use it lightly with better battery mode. On high performance it will die in 2 hour. If you play games it will die in less than an hour and half. Very bad battery. Slow responsive. Pc runs at over 50% for something simple like browsing the net. Wifi gets disconnected for a second in every 30-45 mins. I had search the net like a mad man to fix it, then gave up completely rebooted the new pc. Then it got fixed. Went through extra hassle for that. The customer service just told me to update the drivers, which it was already updates. They don't know anything. Clueless employees. I like the Screen and built quality I guess.I am never buying anything from Amazon ever again.",2,0,3,2,2

I turn the brightness up and it just get whiter. Turn it down and it gets blacker. The sound works well but the speaker are on the bottom which is strange. I never cared for the mouse on a laptop, I use a mini wireless mouse and it works great. Works great for games, watching TV, using Microsoft Office. There is one gaming website I haven't been able to work with my computer. Not sure what the problem is. I did lots of research before buying and I think for all that is desired in this laptop, it is a great buy with all it offers in screen size, storage, and speed. It also has a DVD player which I really wanted included. Compared to similar computers at other stores, most of them without DVD players, they were more expensive and I think this was a great buy for the price and features offered.

Its specs were well worth the price; this machine runs better than my Toshiba when it first came out of its box and has exceeded my expectations. I have had zero issues with this laptop since getting it, it has run all my games fabulously as well as all the programs I need for university and everyday stuff.What I liked:1. Excellent start up time - Laptop loads amazingly fast even from complete shut off it only takes seconds to log in and start up programs.2. Slick aesthetics - I really like the overall design, feel and look of this laptop (it could be made of better materials but its good for its price).3. Good price for specs - After searching through many brands and various laptops I found this one to be a good balance of specs and pricing.4. Keyboard - Always wanted a light up keyboard, the SteelSeries keyboard is nice, smooth and looks great.5. Headphone sound quality - Audio6. Anti glare screen - Must say its amazing the difference between my old Toshiba (and even my sister's Razor) is noticeable. It looks great and I feel like, in addition to the better graphics card, I can see so much more of what's going on on the screen.What I didn't like:1. Short battery life - I got about 3-4 hours of run time before the battery needed to be plugged in, that said the battery life has been/will always be an issue for most powerful gaming machines these days so its not unexpected. Anyone2. Speakers are eh - Generally I use headphones almost all the time with computers however on the occasion that I can't, the speakers on this laptop could be much better.

Then I was only left with about 1GB of disk space, which wasn't enough to do much of anything with additional software loading. Here is what I did to make it more usable: 1) Uninstall the bloatware/adware as much as possible using the control panel UI. 2) Look for Windows 10 powershell commands to remove the rest. 3) Remove the previous version of Windows to free up additional space. This was able to net me a couple more GB, and make things usable again. Otherwise the device is fine. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that would be rarely used, so the price was right.

I am absolutely not going back to the old work laptop (HP 820 G3) and don't think I'd take the other Surface offerings.Things I adore:The 3:2, high-resolution touchscreen is hands down the best screen for getting things done on the go. This blows the prison issue HP Elitebook 820 G3's 16:9 screen out of the water, and, to my untrained eye, is as bright and precise as my 2017 Macbook Pro (used for home use - I like separation of church and state). The 3:2 aspect ratio is magical for the usual trio of Outlook, Excel, and Word.Things I like:In terms of form factor - this reminds me a lot of an older Macbook Air. It's just about the right size, and is featherweight. I'm satisfied with battery life, speakers, and performance. Docking (with one exception, mentioned below in the ""things I hate"" section) is easy and works every time.Things I don't like:The keyboard (lots of pressure necessary to type - much prefer a ThinkPad up to and including T420 keyboard), and general surroundings in alcantara. One of my cars has an alcantara headliner and pillars - which is great because I never touch them. The gray alcantara is begging to get dirty and I think I'm already seeing a bit of a shadow where my right palm rests.Would love a second USB type A port, and would love to have a Windows laptop that doesn't have coil whine. There's a hint of it if the room's silent - nothing like the Dell XPS 13 tried out and ended up returning last year.Things I hate:I'm forced to run a custom Windows 10 Enterprise image and I have scaling problems. My two external monitors are connected via a Surface Dock - two Planar specials at 1440p. I run the laptop at 125% scaling, and the monitors at 100%. No matter which Surface display/dock/whatever driver update I perform, I still have issues upon docking and undocking, that requires me to log out and log back in.",1,2,3,2,4

960,For a inexpensive laptop it is a great bargain. The screen is great. I recommend removing the Bloatware and a little tuning it seems to run great....,1,1,1,4,1
961,"I went into this purchase a little nervous. My other tablet/laptop hybrid experiences had been bad.But I can honestly say this is perfect for my needs. It is very good for annotating PDF files and the pen is more responsive than I expected. It is a little heavy to be used one handed, but it's large enough to brace against your body. I've gotten more arm strain from much smaller lighter devices.As a laptop the keyboard is well sized and easy to type on. All the keys are well placed. My only complaint is that there is no 10 key on the side, but with this size that wouldn't be possible.Battery life is decent, probably 4-8 hours. It multitasks well, I've watched videos with multitab chrome running in the background. Speaking of chrome, it runs great until you get about 12-15 tabs up. Then it get's a little slooooow. The touch screen is as responsive and a flagship smart phone. And I've had no trouble with my wifi connecting at all.I haven't tried any games yet, because I'm assuming it won't have the power. I'll update if I try.",3,2,5,4,3

963,"I bought this computer a month ago and I love it!! It is simple and easy to set up. At first I was afraid I bought the screen too big (I got the 17"") but it is perfect when writing a paper and doing research. I can have two windows open at the same time and easily read both screens. The speed of it is fast and I have never had a frustrating moment with it. I'm in nursing school so I use it daily for several hours at a time. Perhaps my only small complaint is the charge doesn't hold as long as some computers I've used in the past, it will still last several hours but within a few hours it's going dead. Also the fan in it is sometime a little noisy, it never last long, but the first time it did it in class I just thought it was a little loud. Overall I'm very happy I purchased this computer and didn't spend a fortune. It makes school work so much easier!! I definitely would recommend this laptop to anyone!!",1,1,1,3,1

971,"This is a pretty solid laptop. I purchased it about a week ago and it has performed above/beyond my expectations. I switched to this laptop from a Toshiba Satellite, which had such a low processing power that it took an hour for chrome to open. This has an i7 processor which keeps its speeds crisp and quick. To make things easy, I will outline the pros:1. Fast, good processing2. Back-lit Keyboard3. Lightweight, Portable4. Excellent USB Port Access (3 of them)5. Crisp, Vibrant Screen Resolution6. Reasonable Battery Life for a laptop of this size, price rangeThere are a few cons though, but they aren't significant enough for me to lower my rating.1. No CD drive - but this is something I understand since most laptops are made without them nowadays.2. I noticed that removing/inserting anything USB-related is a bit cumbersome. The ports seem a bit too tight for accomadation3. Poor Webcam: the built-in webcam is grainy and is low quality.Thus far, everything else seems pretty good. The pros definitely outweigh the cons. We'll see how well this laptop works over the next few months to years. I will edit this review accordingly.",2,2,1,2,2
972,HiThe battery of the unit died in less than one year. I called Asus support when warranty was expired just by 10 days. The customer representative didn't help me because I was 10 days out of warranty. Not only product was bad but had bad customer experience.,3,1,5,4,3

988,"Thanks, very fast notebook",3,1,5,4,3
989,Volume was not working. I called Asus support 2 days after receiving my laptop. They said I probably needed to add some additional drivers or get some driver updates. They would help me only if I bought an ongoing support contract with them. I refused. Told them I had it for 2 days and it is a brand new machine and that they should support it. Their answer was that because I bought it from Amazon it was not their problem. They would have done it for me at no cost if I had bought the laptop directly from Asus. Horrible way to run a company so I returned the item and am looking at hp laptops.,1,4,1,2,2
990,"At first, everything worked well. I upgraded to regular Windows 10 so that I can install software unlike previous Windows version. Everything worked great for 3 months. The only issue I had was the face recognition sign in, which seemed to only work about a fifth of the time. It's also a pity that the monitor wasn't 360 degrees too. However, overall I really liked the laptop. It was nice and light, and could fit in my purse really well. However, after 3 months, it just stopped working without any reason. There was no physical damage to the laptop whatsoever, I simply closed it like normal one night, and it wouldn't boot up 2 hours later. Monitor went black, and only the keyboard would light up. So while it was working, it worked great despite the iffy face recognition sign in. The touch screen was sensitive enough, and it woke up from sleep reasonably well timed. I've contacted Microsoft support and thankfully there is a 1 year warrante, however, it means they will simply just probably replace it with refurbished one. It's a bit saddening that it only lasted 3 months or so and that now anything on it will be wiped. Hopefully, the next laptop will be longer lasting. Overall, in working shape, it was relatively a 4 star. My only complaints were the face sign in, it wasn't 360 degrees bendable, and the magnetic charging chord often would fall out.",1,2,3,2,4

1008,"I saw a couple of the reviews and got really worried! First off this is my first Windows laoptop in six years . I have been an avid chromebook user. With my sons egging me on how much steal this was at the sale price and touchscreen feature I decided to give it a try. With a bit of help from them I was up and running in less than 15 min. They helped me download Google Chrome and login. All my bookmarks and fav sites swooped right over from my chromebook including all my settings and most of my passwords! Some I had to re-enter and confirm for security reason but that's not a big issue at all. It is an absolutely beautiful machine. Now the speed is about the same for me because i have a supercharged Acer Chromebook 13 so they have the same Ram. But the screen size and touchscreen has me gobbsmacked! Also I did not expect the beautiful rose pattern on the keyboard of the rose gold. Nice detail! I mostly use mine for basic stuff like watching movies, facebook E-mail so Ram is not a big deal for me. The speed is a little better but not much. If you are looking for something for work or gaming there are similar HP on here with a lot more RAM and better processors but be ready to pay more money but I think it would be worth it!",1,1,1,4,1

1015,"I don't like to give 1-star reviews but unfortunately I have to for this one. In addition to running very, very slowly, it has had consistent issues when I use it. Sometimes, it'll shut down on me while in use, sometimes it won't open apps (such as steam which is the primary purpose of purchasing this gaming laptop), sometimes it won't recognize that I have headphones inserted, as examples. Overall it has performed very poorly and slowly, not something I expected from a new laptop of this quality. The graphics are excellent, and the performance while in-game is strong for the most part, but outside of that, my old Lenovo laptop I've had the past five years runs better.",2,0,1,2,1
1016,This is a nice computer. The processor is fairly fact and the set up was very easy. The only issue with the laptop is that the battery life could be better. Using it for normal browsing you get approximately 4 hours this is below the 5 hours average as stated by the Website.,1,4,1,3,2
1017,"I love this computer. I am in CAD heavy classes and use Solidworks, ANSYS, Blender, etc, quite frequently. I have had no issues running any graphics and processing-heavy programs or games. The startup is really fast. The fan is awesome - I can feel the laptop getting hot on my lap then the fan's kick in and the difference is incredible; it actually begins to feel cold (not even warm). The display is clear, the sound is clear. The battery lasts surprisingly long for a gaming laptop, too! I can get at least 4-5 hours on ""better battery"" mode (the estimate says over 7 but I'm typically never away from a power outlet that long), which was better than my last laptop. Given the price, this laptop does more than I could have hoped for. This is probably one of the best laptops I've owned.",1,0,1,2,2

1019,Samsung makes great TVs but they do not make good laptops. The Chromebook Plus was not good. Overall it is kinda pricey and also it lags in performance. I think my older PC is a lot faster than this. It also did not work with all the apps that I wanted to use on my laptop. Some shut down others didnt even work properly. The pen sucks too. Falls out and has a slow reaction time when it comes to how it works with the unit. Plus it is a weird shape not a standard long length. Overall I dont like it at all and I like most chromebooks.

I let windows do its updates, ive updated every single driver, ran memory and hard disk checks, tried everything from the forums on how to fix these and they still persist. Every game ive tried blue screens between 1 and 10 minutes in. Ive done fresh installs on the games, tried installing on both drives. tried changing the settings, running in 32 bit, and the end is still the same. After the crap I went through even getting this thing after amazon sent me a box of exhaust parts instead of the computer and then spent 3 weeks delaying my refund only to act like i did something wrong and then finally give me a refund after hinting that they still didnt believe me I had hoped my problems were finally over and i would have an awesome gaming machine...nope. I basically have a $1600 tablet because all I can do is surf the internet and check emails. I am so disappointed with this purchase.

Works when just typing, you want to use it to play a game no dice, and I mean AT ALL.This effects ALL keyboards that are attached to the computer. Bluetooth, USB and the built in one.You want to walk somewhere, too bad. It wont recognize that you pressed the key, unless you press it 10 times. Open you bags, NOPE.Want to hit the esc button to log out, too bad.Want to press 2 movement keys at the same time HAHAHAHHAHA...no, not even once did I get that to work.This as you can tell makes the ""gaming"" laptop pretty much useless for gaming.Run away from this as fast as you can, unless you just want an over priced laptop.Also for those wondering what kind of FPS they are looking at for games. At May of 2017 it will do about 50 FPS on lvl 5 (of 10) for World of Warcraft. Lets just say my desktop that is 7 years old and has a 3 year old basic graphics card does better FPS.Edit: After calling Dells tech support and getting nothing but transferred around to people that were pushing a ""premium service"" I found that if you adjust one of the graphic card settings everything works well. Still only 3 stars due to horrible customer service and the fact that this laptop with a 15 inch screen is the same size as my 17inch screen old laptop.",1,0,3,2,2

1035,"*Update March 17, 2017*Having used the Samsung Chromebook Plus every day since I got it, and mostly ignoring my MacBook Pro with 15"" Retina Display, I believe that the Plus is the first real ""iPad killer"" I've come across. By that I mean, it fulfills the promise to replace a laptop for almost all uses while addressing the shortcomings of tablets. The keyboard is built in, there is a track pad and touch screen with stylus, no separate case is required, and the rotating screen provides genuinely useful orientations. It's fast, battery life is good, charging is quick, the screen is fantastic, it can drive external displays, and it's reasonably light. The Chrome browser is first rate, and it can run thousands of apps! I've been using the Plus extensively at home and while traveling - for browsing, watching videos, taking handwritten notes (see update on LectureNotes below), email, photos, reading Kindle books, music, maps, games - you name it. The Plus and others like it are the portable do-it-all devices of the future.*Original Review and updates*I've had a few days to play with the Chromebook Plus and so far I love it! I've been looking to replace my Samsung Tab Pro 12.2"" tablet (the Note Pro without a pen). The Chromebook Plus seemed perfect as it can be folded over to be a tablet, and can also be used like a regular laptop. Plus it runs Chrome and Android apps.Overall I really like it. It's size is just right, a bit heavier than the Tab / Note Pro and a bit squarer (see attached comparison pictures). The screen is really good and I only need to put it on 1/2 brightness. It's aspect ratio is 3:2 which is perfect for browsing and using as a tablet. The touchscreen works very well. I love that I don't need a special case to prop it up; the 360 degree hinge allows you to situate the screen at whatever angle you choose.Chrome runs very well. It's about twice as fast as the Tab / Note Pro tablet (see attached ""Octane"" benchmark image). Having windows is great and I have more than 20 tabs open in 4 windows with no issues. Windows are only available in laptop mode. In tablet mode it makes every app full screen. I'm expecting tablet mode to get windows when the underlying Android subsystem gets updated from Marshmallow to Nougat.Android apps generally work really well. The Kindle app is great. Google photos, Google Inbox, NY Times, all work fine although often I find no need for an Android app if there is a Chrome web version of the app. Google Maps is much better on Chrome because it shows you the 3D satellite view. Google Inbox is faster on the app version though so I use that. Sonos does not work as of this writing, as it could not find my Sonos system. I've opened a ticket with them. *Update May 25, 2017* Sonos works now.I loaded up the ""Asphalt 8"" road racing app and it was very responsive. I didn't see any stuttering as seen on some of the online reviews of the Chromebook Pro. Go figure!Battery life is good, I'm getting between 7 and 9 hours. Apps that uses the CPU a lot can reduce that quickly. To see which tabs / apps are using the most CPU, you can bring up the task manager by pressing the ""search"" and ""esc"" keys. I've found that tabs that aren't visible don't use as much CPU. Amazon often uses a lot of CPU when it's tab is visible, so I close it or switch to another tab when not using it. For some reason the Google Hangouts extension was eating a lot of CPU, so I disabled it.The keyboard works well, although it is somewhat mushy and the delete key is too small so I often press = by mistake. The touch pad works well for two finger scrolling and you can enable ""tap and drag"" in Accessibility settings. It has a slight rebound when two finger scrolling down a web page; when you lift your fingers the page scrolls goes back a tiny bit in the opposite direction that you were scrolling. I hope Google/Samsung can address this soon. *Update Feb 18, 2017* This was fixed by a recent update, there is no longer any ""bounce back"".The Samsung Chromebook Plus seems like a real keeper! Some here have suggested waiting for the Chromebook Pro, but I'm not sure that makes sense as the Plus is here today, is fast and reliable, and is a joy to use!*Update Feb 18, 2017*I am having Bluetooth issues. Sometimes it cuts in and out while playing music on the Google Music web site. Or it will stop playing through the Bluetooth speaker and start playing through the built in speakers, even though the Bluetooth connection is still established. Hope this can be fixed soon! *Update Mar 4, 2017* This is supposed to be fixed soon in ChromeOS 57. *Update May 25, 2017* Bluetooth is working fine now.I found a very nice note taking app that responds to pressure from the stylus, called Squid. There is a toolkit add-on for $2.99 that gives more features like geometric shapes.*Update Feb 21, 2017*I'm finding that I can have many Chrome windows and tabs open, many more than suggested in reviews. Right now for instance, I have 41 tabs in 13 windows open.*Update Feb 22, 2017*For those of you who like to keep lots of tabs and windows open (tab hoarding), I found this great Chrome extension called The Great Discarder. It automatically suspends idle tabs to reduce Chrome memory usage using Chrome's native tab discarding. When you do visit a suspended tab it automatically reloads. With this extension you can have as many tabs open as you want! Get it at the Chrome web store.*Update Feb 28, 2017*I installed the Android version of Skype for Business to attend work meetings. I found that clicking web links to Skype meetings did not work. The link is opened in the Chromebook's Chrome browser, which doesn't know how to send it to Skype, since Chromebook's Chrome is not an Android app. I found a work-around, which is to install Chrome for Android. Now when I click on a Skype web link from an Android app, I can choose whether to open it in the Chromebook's Chrome or in Android's Chrome. Opening it in Android's Chrome, it then gets passed properly to the Skype Android app.*Update Mar 4, 2017*I looked at some of the note taking apps on the Play store, including Squid, INKredible, SketchBook, HandWrite Pro Note and Draw, and LectureNotes. LectureNotes isn't as flashy as some of the others, and the interface is not as pretty, but it is very comprehensive in how you set it up and use it. Pressure sensitive stylus, custom pencils and eraser, draw with stylus / erase with finger, basic geometric shapes, very good selection tools, layers... about the only thing it fell down on was it doesn't go full screen in the tablet portrait mode.LectureNotes was the only one that let me import a PDF and then select, copy, cut, and paste from the PDF itself as opposed to just drawing over it. To get PDF import functionality you have to download the developer's PDFView app.",2,4,5,4,5

1046,"I truly wanted to like this laptop. But after buying 2 (1 from Best Buy and the other from the Microsoft Store) and experiencing the same problem, I have to call it quits. I can't find anyone else talking about this problem: there is sound distortion, and it's not a defect, it's simply an effect of the design. Let me explain.The speakers in this laptop are placed somewhere under the keyboard. When the sound is turned high up (typically 70/100 or higher), and under certain music, the sound waves coming from the speakers under the keyboard cause some of the chiclet keys to vibrate a lot. These vibrations produce high pitched buzzing noises. The kind of music I have found this most noticeable on is classic piano music. At first I thought I had a busted speaker. However upon returning the laptop and getting another with the same problem, I had to do some investigating. Eventually I found that when I touch some keys to prevent them from vibrating, the distortion goes away, and when I let go it comes back.I simply can't deal with this. It is extremely noticeable to me. Otherwise this laptop is great. It has the best keyboard of all the ones I've tested which was really important to me. Such a shame...",1,2,3,2,4

After a few weeks when it would not even let me restart or shut down the laptop, is when I decided to use the rapidity closing 30 say return option. I think that I learned never to buy a PC product again, and especially one with almost no storage, and only one USB slot. I can't believe that such an awful product can be marketed in 2017.

The laptop has also stopped picking up wifi without being two feet or less away from the router, which I would assume is related to the fact that the computer is just falling apart from normal (and I'd even say minimal) use and I don't think I can perfectly seal off the interior of the laptop from the outside environment.You should probably follow the old adage that ""you get what you pay for"" and pay a little more for something that isn't of appalling quality.

1091,"First things first: only get this if you don't mind having an absolutely awful screen. This is not a laptop for artists, with its washed out TN panel and poor angles. However, I'm not an artist, so this is a neutral point in my book. 1080p is good enough.Next, this thing's hard drive is abysmal and often causes the system to grind to a halt. However, this doesn't actually matter all that much if you know a thing or two about laptops, from which my next point follows.If you just want a laptop that works well right out of the box then maybe consider something else because you are NOT going to find something in this price range that matches that description. However, one of it's downsides: the thickness, is a blessing in disguise. Literally every issue I have with it can be upgraded away. Hard drive too slow? Install an SSD. Screen too awful? Replace it with an IPS touch panel. Not enough RAM? Add more! You can buy this laptop as a base to upgrade into a very capable machine.This thing is so cheap for the amount of power behind it, I genuinely can't think of a better system at this price point for running games. The fact that it has a GPU means that it will be capable for years. Right now you can play most games comfortably on medium settings and sometimes higher at 1080p 60fps which is more than I can say for game consoles. This thing just annihilates Minecraft and Wii emulation. It's great for making videogame grade 3D models in blender, and I've never experienced slow down in Unity. Photoshop and Adobe Premiere work fine, however the screen means you shouldn't really get this laptop if your primary concern is color accuracy.",1,0,1,2,2
1092,"It does not come with any adapters to convert the smaller ports (micro usb and usb-c) to standard usb ports. The viewing angles is pretty bad, about 90 degrees total left to right or up to down (45 degree from center any direction) loses color then coherency.",2,2,5,4,3
1093,"The Acer Aspire E15 is designed for a specific audience. It is not a gaming computer. It is designed for someone who wants to go on the internet, surf the internet, stream some shows, and type some documents. This would be ideal for someone who is a student or someone who wants a travel computer just for consuming media (in fact, it as a DVD drive, which none of my other gaming laptops have!).The computer is relatively slow at most tasks, which is normal for a basic computer running an i3 processor. It takes a few seconds longer for most tasks, including turning it on, opening a web browser, or opening an app. However, everything works. If you do not expect lightning speed, then this computer works with no problems.The only real issue is that because the computer is already so slow, too many open applications make it nearly impossible to use. This is not necessarily the fault of the computer; it was built that way. It is the fault of the intrusive programs. Norton anti-virus is a very aggressive program, and when McAfee got installed during a Flash update, having two intrusive, aggressive anti-virus programs open at the same time made the computer chug so much, I thought it crashed. Once they were uninstalled, and other apps closed, the computer ran at a normal speed.If you are looking for a basic laptop such as this, then I recommend you cleanup programs you do not want, fine-tune the WiFi settings (I had to change mine because it kept losing connections to my router), and run the Windows updates. Once this is done, you will have a perfectly fine machine. Right now, it is a perfect computer for my son, who is learning to use the internet for research, play some web browser based games through his school, and listen to CDs through the DVD drive (this type of optical drive is slowly being phased out of laptops, so I am super impressed it has one). If this sounds like the kinds of things you want to do, then I recommend this computer.",2,2,1,3,2

1100,"Initially I bought this through Amazon but cancelled quickly when I realized Microsoft offers a student discount. So far I have had this 2 days and it has not been bad but it certainly has not been great either. I don't think I had Windows 10 S for an hour before I quickly upgraded it Windows 10 Pro. As stated before Windows 10 S will NOT let you install 3rd party applications unless they are in the Microsoft store. So that means you are stuck with limited VPN options, Edge Browser, and a ton of other limitations. The trade off is real and significant. For Windows 10 Pro you can install the programs you want; however rest assured your battery life will suffer tremendously. I was at 100% about 20 minutes ago but after moderate use (no streaming videos or music) I am down to 92%. I think it is fair to say Windows 10 Pro kills the battery life Microsoft touted as being amazing. Microsoft informs users that you can downgrade back to Windows 10 S if you choose free of charge. The touch screen is nice as is the material surrounding the keyboard. The screen resolution is absolutely on point. I have the i5 8GB 256 GB model and I have to say it is much slower than I anticipated. It looks like many others are reporting the same thing. I'm not sure the more expensive i7 would make that much of a difference. In addition, the facial recognition software to unlock your computer is inconsistent at best and I could totally see myself strictly using the pin procedure to access if it keeps up its shenanigans. All and all it is a good attempt by Microsoft, does it beat it's Macbook Air counterpart? In my opinion, no. As I am deeply entrenched in both ecosystems, Apple and Microsoft (I love both) I can say with the utmost confidence that it is a good computer but not great and certainly not worth the hefty $1299 price tag.",0,2,3,2,4

Everything I tested has worked flawlessly.Intel i5-8250U processorIt is a mid-range processor, quite adequate for most home uses including picture and video editing. Don't just assume that i7 is more powerful than i5 because many i7 processors are much inferior compared to this i5 processor. Always compare the processor performance benchmark numbers on PassMark CPU Benchmark site before concluding one way or the other. According to PassMark numbers, this i5-8250U CPU is not bad at all.8GB memoryWhile 4GB is enough for most home uses like browsing, email, word processing, spreadsheets, etc., 8GB is preferred if you plan to do occasional photo editing and normal video editing (using, say, Microsoft MovieMaker). Any serious video editing may require more memory.256GB SSDWhile solid state drives offer you much better performance for read/write operations, they also come with a smaller capacity. It will help with quick boot up and wake from sleep or hibernation. Also, it will help with quick shutdown, sleep, and hibernation. Obviously, copying pictures and videos from your camera/camcorder/phone will be very fast too. However, a regular hard drive for a similarly priced laptop would have been 1TB or larger. Personally, I don't need a larger drive because I regularly take double backups and delete from the computer.ScreenBeautiful and sharp screen. I am very satisfied.Built-in speakersI am not impressed by the speakers. They are on the bottom surface of the keyboard and don't produce good sound. Expect to use headphones or external speakers.

Another concern was networking. My old PC used to max out in the 6Mbps range -- but this one delivers 15Mbps consistently on the same equipment. Nice! My next concern was the limited drive space. I use the 32 GB for programs -- and with the great networking, I keep most of my files in the cloud (One Drive and iCloud). Sweet! My final concern was the keyboard -- would it be large enough to accommodate power typing. The designers did away with the unneeded calculator keys, and that leaves plenty of space for uncramped typing. Good performance; fast networking that reaches farther than my old PC; plenty of drive space for my program; nice keyboard -- and great price -- I'm very pleased.",3,1,5,4,3

1126,"I love this laptop. Coming from a triple-boot MacBook Pro 13"" 12,1 I was seriously doubting the ASUS would compete, but I actually like it better.First thing I did was shrink Windows 10 to install Linux on 1/2 the 256 GB SSD. Everything works great in Ubuntu 17.04, except for the fingerprint reader which is an ""unknown device"" in print and another driver I tried. I don't need the fingerprint reader to work, but it's been flawless everywhere else, and I am a Linux main (work tools).My only gripes could be that the sound is pretty quiet in Windows and though I can get over 100% in Linux it will distort past 100%. Another gripe would be the touchpad isn't as good as my previous MacBook, but that's not much of a surprise. Also the AC power supply is rather cheap, but I couldn't care less about that. If anything I like that I could probably get a generic replacement adapter at Walmart or Goodwill if I need one.The battery life of this ASUS is awesome- I don't need to charge it all day with regular usage. It's very light compared to my MacBook 13"". The keyboard is great and just as good as the Apple in my opinion. The screen is great at 1080p, the i5 eigth gen is fast, the disk is fast. This laptop is built well and does not feel as inexpensive as it is.I don't think there is a better laptop in this price range. Seriously check this one out if you need an ultralight!",3,3,3,2,4
1127,"Very nice, smooth operation. Like it a lot.",2,2,5,4,2
1128,"I bought this Chromebook Plus for my niece for her high school graduation present, a year ago last Saturday. It was worth every penny, and then some! She isn't really a computer person, and was much more comfortable using her school's Chromebook and my old Acer P720 than her own laptop. So a Chromebook was the obvious choice for her, but there were so many to choose from, I spent alot of time researching them all. I chose the Samsung Chromebook Plus for her because it had everything she would need for her personal use and college needs. She loved it then, and she loves it now! A year of daily use, it is still going strong and it has served her well, at school and at home. Ease of use, built-in security and frequent updates made this the right choice for us. I would absolutely recommend the Samsung Chromebook Plus.",2,4,5,4,5
1129,"Previous Acer computers have been great. This one not so much. I see Acer heading the same way as Dell. I understand that this is an economic purchase, but its not recommended to lower the quality of your product just to meet price points. Two examples: Apple vs Dell. Which is worth almost a trillion?",3,4,5,4,3
1130,"So far, one of the most beautiful computing devices I have owned so far. That's a real statement considering I have owned more than 15 laptops in the past decade.The screen is a stunner, touchpad and keyboard are simply fantastic and the sound is surprisingly loud and clear. The ports leave a lot to be desired but isn't a deal breaker. Although I have yet to confirm true daily performance and battery life, so far it has been overwhelmingly positive. I only felt this when I had ordered the Dell XPS ultrathin but was quickly reminded of its deal breaking limitations.You'll want to show this off and will equally enjoy using it as your daily driver. Definitely remember to use the free upgrade to Windows 10 pro until the S version has a store that is well populated with the most critical windows apps for power users and general users alike.",0,2,3,2,4
1131,"this is a good laptop for most use cases except for heavy gaming. But I will recommend the 14 inch version over this, as both have the same footprint, only 14 inch version has thinner bezels",3,2,3,2,4

1134,"This fanless laptop performs quite nicely with the new Intel processor inside. Web browsing feels fast and snappy compared to prior generation laptops around this price point. It's funny what a difference a year can make in low end PC performance. 4GB of RAM is good for multitasking.While I like the performance I was disappointed that the laptop has so little storage. 32GB isn't much and it will prevent the installation of more applications. SD cards inserted into the laptop's card reader do not sit flush to the unit making carrying additional storage less convenient.The 14 inch display, while large and at a nice 1080p resolution is a very low quality TN display. If the screen is not positioned properly the image will look washed out or lose its clarity.Video playback is dramatically improved over prior generation hardware and it should have no issues playing back HEVC video : even the high bit rate stuff. I was impressed to see that on a low cost laptop.Overall this isn't a bad deal for the price tag. I would have liked to see more storage but if you're looking for a Windows laptop to run a few applications and spend the rest of your time in the cloud this should be sufficient.",3,4,5,4,3
1135,"Good computer for the price. Very light weight. Very good volume. It has some features that are just irrelevant for home use but it is a business standard. I am happy with it. I wish the delivery had been as secure as the computer bag delivery was. They just left it at the door when I had a message that it had to be signed for due to the price. Luckily we were going out when the mailman was walking away, so no one got a chance to steal it.",2,2,1,2,2

1140,So far this laptop is what I was expecting! A quality computer for decent gaming. I can use fairly decent graphic settings on my games and still get a good FPS it has an awesome design and isnt too bulky. The keyboard is kind of close together but its a laptop what do you expect. I was however disappointed with amazons delivery packaging. They used a box much larger than the laptop box itself which could have risked the computers safety.,2,0,3,2,2
1141,"The only thing you should worry about this small laptop is disk capacity which is 32GB. It took me about 12 hours to upgrade to the new version of Windows 10. That's why I had to return it. Acer should have made it 64GB.Other than that, the screen is perfect, sharp and clear full HD, battery life is fantastic, I took it to the library and most of the time I was watching videos from youtube and still it lasted like 4 hours and another 4 hours were left.It's very light, keyboard is OK, Wifi is lightning fast and problem free.I just upgraded to a new and more expensive one but still it's Acer.So, if your budget is limited and you think you can live with 32GB disk(you know you can always attach a microSD anyway) this laptop is probably the best laptop on the planet with that price tag.",3,4,5,4,3
1142,You will have to move the screen up and down to see clearly especially in dark games. It is really annoying to have 80% brightness in some games without any benefit. Any change in your sitting position needs adjustment in screen position.,1,0,1,2,2

1146,"The Good: It's really, really cheap. I bought this with the intent of using it only for some quick web-surfing and maybe some occasional word-processing. I didn't need a laptop with high-end components, and this seemed to fit the bill. A huge added bonus was the fact that it came with HD Display, especially at this price that seemed to be a great deal.The Bad: While I knew it was bare-bones purchasing it, I wasn't expecting the performance to be so shoddy! At only 4GB of RAM, it doesn't have enough memory for simple web-browsing. My user experience is constantly ruined by alerts from Windows that my RAM is getting used up and programs need to be closed. These alerts can come with only one web-browser that has two tabs opened up. As such the computer is constantly freezing up.Conclusion: While it may seem like an outstanding deal with HD Display at such a low price, the low amount of RAM makes it very difficult to use. You are constantly maxing out your memory usage with minimal programs open, and as such the laptop is constantly bogged down and freezing up. Spend a little more money on a device that comes with at least 8GB RAM.",3,4,5,4,3
1147,"I love my new Chromebook. It's lightweight, the battery lasts a long time and the tablet feature is awesome. I love the very responsive touchscreen, too.

1148,"This laptop was a massive disappointment. Ive had a MacBook for the past 10 years and this was like trying to use a flip phone again. The trackpad is useless, it lags, the screen is subpar, and it managed to find and download a virus within the first 30 mins of me using it. Thank you windows. On top of all that it apparently belonged to a Miss Mcloed before me because it had a bunch of stuff saved on there and after I closed it for the first time it kicked me out because I dont actually have Miss Mcloeds password. Youd think if these people were going to send me a used computer they would atleast give me the password to it. Oh well I had to send it back.

1153,"The Acer Nitro 5 feels very fragile. I was in constant fear of breaking it. Part of that is the fact that I dropped, all told, $750 on this piece of equipment and that makes you worry about those things, but the bigger part is that it's simply cheaply made. This laptop looks great on paper, and you KNOW they have to cut corners somewhere, right? Well Acer decided to sacrifice build quality here, and it shows. Well, it doesn't show, and that's the problem. You won't realize it's cheaply made until you actually get your hands on it; feel the tightness of the usb ports when you plug something in and wonder if they're going to break, as you place the laptop in your bag and have serious doubts about its ability to hold up to simple foot travel.In terms of hardware it really is a good deal, but there's a reason other laptops in this category go for several hundred dollars more. They are built to last. This isn't.Mine came with a defective screen. There was significant backlight bleed (yellow splotches of light around the edges of the screen that show up when dark colors are displayed) that got worse over the few weeks I owned it. Acer would cover a replacement screen under warranty and asked me to send it in. They wanted me to pay for shipping, but I asked them to cover shipping both ways because it was a manufacturing defect, and they agreed without any hassle. I'm upset that my brand-new PC was defective out of the gate and I had to ship it in for repairs. I returned it instead because I could not trust the build quality. Acer is a good brand but save up and get a predator instead.3 stars for the laptop. It's not actually that bad. Docked a star for poor quality control.",2,0,3,2,2
1154,"Beautiful laptop with amazing specs. Two of the small details that really help set this laptop apart from others are that the keyboard is very quiet while typing and that it's Signature Edition.

Ended up being very quick, and painless getting the laptop set up with all of my preferences.",2,1,1,2,2
1155,This is a great Laptop. The AMD FX is an awesome processor. I ordered 5 of these for our office and they all work great. They fire up fast. They run any application that I've used so far with ease. The only downside to this laptop is the slow WiFi card. It is definitely under powered for this machine. We have 150 Mbps WiFi capabilities in our offices. These laptops can't seem to clear 54 Mbps speeds over WiFi.,2,1,1,2,2

1160,"After hours of research and even one returned MSI, I ended up with an Acer Predator 17 i7-7700HQ GTX1070 8GB. This thing is massive power in a massive body. It's honestly probably too powerful since the display is only 1080p and 75hz so you might want to consider just going with the GTX 1060 version.Pros: Runs anything on ultra, stays super cool, great build quality, doesn't look as bad in person. Cons: over 10 pounds with the power supply, you'll need a special bag to carry it, definitely has that gamer look to it.This thing is a performance machine. With a GTX 1070 it can take all you throw at it. However, the 75hz 1080p display will leave you wanting more. Wish it at least came with a 1440p display and 120hz. I think there was an option that did but it didn't have the IPS display and whatever. It's fine. I also like the number of ports. It's got enough USB ports and even a thunderbolt 3 which I didn't find on many competitors.Cooling is fantastic. I read test results and found it ran cooler than MSI and ASUS competitors. My MSI ran so hot I thought I was going to burn myself. The i7-7700 seems to run hot and CAM keeps alerting me that the CPU hit over 80 degrees. Intel says this is normal so I'm not too worried.Construction: The Predator feels solid. In pictures the body looks cheap and the red keys look really tacky but in person it's really well done. The soft touch plastic has a nice feel and the red keys are semi-tacky but I really don't mind. Besides, I'm not bringing this thing to Starbucks to work and at 9.4 pounds you won't want to bring this monster anywhere and if you do, you'll need a special bag because it won't fit in regular 17"" bags. I chose the ASUS ROG Shuttle backpack since the Predator bag was twice the price. It also has that gamer look to it so if you want stealth, I'd recommend the Gigabyte 17"" version which is a lot cleaner and has the same specs.Other pros, the keyboard is fantastic and the touchpad is really smooth. Hated the touchpad on my MSI and the mouse buttons were hard to press. Downside to construction: the wrist rest has a sharpish edge and can dig into your arm after a while. A rounded or angled front edge would make the laptop more comfortable, especially since it's so thick. That's really the only complaint...Overall: Yeah, I'm pretty psyched about the Predator. It really wasn't on my radar at all while shopping and the horrible pictures really turned me off. After having my heart set on a ROG or MSI, I was stunned to finally go with Acer but so far so good. Really no regrets (other than that I should have bought a tower instead lol)Oh one last thing, the startup sound can EASILY be turned off in like 3 steps. Just google it and everyone in a 2-mile radius will thank you. Acer if you're reading this, get rid of it.Hopefully this helps you choose a new laptop! Enjoy whatever you buy!",2,0,1,0,1

That's about once every 3-4 days of casual use for me. The only improvement I can think of is to make the keys a little more curved instead of flat. But other than that, it's a perfect laptop. Does not come with a huge amount of bloatware that needs to be removed. The speakers are not too bad either.The Dell XPS 13 may be better but at $1300 compared to this one at $750, this one is a much better value.",3,3,3,2,4

I would say this product is good for the price that it has, i would definetly recommend it for teens or for a laptop that you would just have for entertainment scince it doesn't include any microsoft programs.

Once I learned Microsoft 365 could help me with their products for free I cancelled the other subscription but they wouldnt refund my $59 because they said they did work on my computer what they did was not what I asked for and never gave me any insight into Windows 10.

1179,"I am so excited with this laptop. It is a medium to high end Intel laptop that comes with Windows 10. I have used Dell equipment in the past and in my opinion, they are not sexy as some others, but were work horse that are solid and reliable. My main computer now is a Mac (yes I am in the Apple orbit), so often times I compared other computers to Apple standard. This is one of the rare times I am excited about a laptop that was not from Apple.To start with, the screen is gorgeous. High resolution (1920x1080) and deep color, this makes everything beautiful from reading a magazine to watch movie a wonderful experience. Intel I5 and 256GB SSD help make the computer really fast. 8GB is so so, I wish I have more but for now, it seems sufficient. The whole computer is a bit heavier and bulkier than some other in the same class, but I believe there is a good reason for that: Touch Screen!It took a little bit to get used to, and I do worry that I will get used to this and start touching other laptop's screen! Think of a giant tablet with a keyboard attached. The screen is very responsive, browser windows closes or navigate nicely, just a light touch. I worried for a minute that my finger is too big for the screen, but that was not the case. The screen navigate just like an iPad, awesome! Of course, if you don't want to use the touch screen, the keyboard and touch pad let you operate like a regular laptop. Indefinite viewing position too.The laptop comes generously with 3 USB and a HDMI port, so you can actually hook to your TV and make it a media center. One thing that is different (and it took me a minute to figure out): the power on button is on the bottom right side instead of keyboard side.Over all, I am excited about this laptop and have used it regularly. My MacBook Pro is kind of gathering dust right now.",1,2,3,2,4
1180,"I purchased this item from a local big box because of a promotion they were running. This is my first chromebook and I am pleasantly surprised. For what I intend to use it for: emails, web surfing, and school work it seems to provide enough performance to accomplish those tasks. The aspect ratio of the screen is at first, odd. After using it for awhile, I've grown to appreciate it's size and clarity. The display is bright and sharp and very comfortable to look at. The included stylus resembles the S-pen from Samsung's line of Note devices and is more a novelty for me than a key tool. It does work well, and provides some interesting tools for interacting with the operating system. The ability to manipulate the position of the screen is an amazing feature. Being able to transition from laptop, tent, to tablet forms is a lot more useful than I had originally imagined.Coming for a mid-2012 Macbook Pro, the keyboard is definitely smaller and the trackpad isn't as smooth. However, the savings in weight is enough for me to overlook those minor issues. The inclusion of the app store is definitely a welcome addition, but there are issues that cause apps to crash randomly. As this function is still in beta, I was prepared for this and do not consider it as big an issue as it may seem.My main motivation for purchasing this product, was to avoid having to bring my laptop and additional tablet with me on a deployment.

Battery life is exceptional. Light/portable. Way better than any tablet. Screen is crisp and clear. Keyboard feel is great. Mousepad works great (not oversensitive). Plugable Bluetooth mouse works great with this. Will allow me to be very productive on the road. HIGHLY recommend!!",3,1,5,4,3
1201,"I own several Chromebooks. This has a great, bright screen like my Pixel LS 2015. Another reviewer said that the web pages load slow and I have to agree. So much so, I will be returning this. I ran several tests side by side with my much older and slower CPU Chromebooks running the same latest version of Chrome OS on the same network. The Samsung web pages took 5-10 seconds longer to render. It is painful to wait for every page. Not sure why this is happening. I will try the Pro version when it comes out and maybe they will have this fixed in that one. Makes no sense why. Save yourself the pain on this one.",2,4,5,4,5

It shuts off randomly and when on sleep mode, will frequently switch itself on and drain the battery over night. I've taken it to multiple people for check up and fixes and other than some serious hardware flaws, no one can quite figure out the problem.I'm quite gentle with my devices. I carry them in cases, I keep them clean and relatively dust free, I update my software including malware protection regularly but for whatever reason, this Asus has continued to be a let down.Not to mention absolutely zero customer service.

1217,"UPDATE: May 30, 2018: Do Not Buy This Laptop! The screen on mine broke for no apparent reason that I can think of. I did not drop the laptop, sit on the laptop, bend the laptop, hit the laptop on the edge of a desk or anything else that I am aware of. I handle this laptop with the utmost of care and this morning when I opened it I noticed some ""streaks"" on the screen that I attributed to cleaning with my microfiber cloth the previous day. But to my horror, it was not streaks but cracks in the screen. When I called the Microsoft Support Line, the first option was for broken screens. So do you think there is a problem with these Surface Laptops developing cracked screens? Duh. Well yeah. Unless you purchased the optional extended warranty, you are going to have to pay $450 for an out of warranty replacement. Sorry Microsoft, Not going to happen. You've lost a customer. UPDATE:July 3, 2017 - I visited a Microsoft Store today. I spent about an hour with a tech who ran the battery test again on my Surface Laptop. The results were basically the same as the results gotten when the Microsoft Support online tech ran the same test. The Surface Laptop battery has a design capacity of 45,200mWh but my battery has a full charge capacity of 48,500mWh. In other words, my battery has more capacity than the design capacity. That will diminish with time of course because Li-ion batteries lose capacity slowly over time. In fact the first time I ran the battery test my battery showed a full charge capacity of 50,000mWh so it has already lost some of that capacity just in the short time I've had the laptop.The most recent run of the Battery Test indicated an estimated battery life based on my usage pattern of 7:13:43 which is essentially what I mentioned I get in my review. The estimated battery life based on the design capacity of the battery is only 6:44:12. The tech basically admitted that the touted 14.5 hour video loop statistic that Microsoft touts is something that no one will get in real life usage. The takeaway is that there is nothing wrong with my battery or with my laptop. The laptop simply does not get anywhere near the advertised 14.5 runtime. So if you are expecting 11, 12 or 13 hours of runtime, you will be disappointed. As for the laptop magazines that run tests that indicate exaggerated runtimes, be very wary. Even Wired magazine agrees that 9-10 hours is a more realistic expectation although I've never gotten close to 10 hours.UPDATE: July 1, 2017 - My review states my overall impressions of the laptop. What I want to update is my great disappointment in the battery life. Microsoft is marketing this as having up to 14.5 hours of video playback (tested using Windows 10 Pro so you would assume that Windows 10s would have slightly better battery life.) The reality after using this for nearly 2 weeks is that I am only getting 7-7.5 hours of battery life. My use of the laptop is mostly word processing, email, Browsing Amazon, Spotify and occasional YouTube video streaming. I contacted Microsoft Technical Support and had a 1 hour chat session where the technician actually ran a screen sharing session on my laptop to check and change settings to help optimize battery life (such as turning off Hey Cortana setting.) He even ran a comprehensive battery usage report which indicated detailed battery use statistics for the previous 3 day period of time. What was gleaned from that was that my battery is discharging at an average rate of 12-15% per hour. Well, do the math. At that rate of discharge, there is no way you'll ever get 14.5 hours of battery life. I feel the whole 14.5 hour of battery life is a misleading metric that is only remotely possible under unlikely circumstances. I purchased this laptop primarily because of the touted long battery life. Now that I've had the Surface Laptop long enough I am able to conclude I will never see anywhere close to the 14.5 hours battery life claimed in the marketing hype. I am very disappointed, I routinely get no more than 7.5 hours of use before needing to recharge, and in some cases only 6.5 hours on a full charge. While I am very happy with the speed of the laptop and gorgeous design, the battery life is not at all meeting my expectations. That is why I am reducing my rating to 3 stars.---- This is a review of the Microsoft Surface Laptop (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB) - Platinum.I'm having a real love-hate relationship with this laptop. First let me give it some love...What a gorgeous laptop. It is thin, lightweight and has excellent build quality. There are no seams on the shell of this laptop. It looks like it was machined out of a solid hunk of aluminum. The laptop is rigid and does not flex. I can hold the front corner of the laptop and it feels totally solid in my hand.The display has touchscreen capabilities and has a 3 x 2 aspect ratio, like the good ol days. The touchscreen is very responsive with no perceptible lag. You can use a stylus with the touchscreen if you wish but the screen only goes back so far and can not be folded underneath the laptop as a would be able to do with a convertible laptop. Pixel density is 201ppi with the screen resolution of 2256 x 1504. That makes it great for working on documents and writing. But with a 3x2 aspect ratio, you may be bothered by the black bars that will be visible on the top and bottom areas of the screen. The display has gorilla glass to give it added strength. The display does have significant glare if used outside or light from windows or lights. I find that I sometimes have to choose my work position carefully to avoid glare. The screen is bright and sharp with excellent color.The only ports are a USB 3 port, a Mini Display Port and an audio output jack, all of those on the left side. The right side has the Surface Connect Docking & Power Port. The AC adapter is small and has a USB output for charging (it is not a data port.)I really like the Windows Hello face recognition feature for unlocking the laptop. It works quite well generally speaking but low light and strong backlighting can render it useless in which case you'll have to unlock the laptop using your PIN. Not a big deal.The trackpad is excellent. One of the best trackpads I've used. I also like the feel and look of the somewhat controversial Alcantara fabric that surrounds the keyboard and trackpad. It feels good when you rest your hand on it, but I do wonder whether in time oils from my skin will cause it to get shiny, collect dirt and who knows what. I'm on the fence about the Alcantara fabric.The laptop has plenty of cons. First and foremost is the fact that there is nothing upgradeable on this laptop. What you get is what you get. This concerns me greatly. It basically means you have a $1200 throwaway computer once the battery loses it's ability to hold a charge, a fate common to all Li-ion batteries. Unless Microsoft has some magical way that nobody knows about to open the laptop up and replace the battery this is a huge consideration. I'm also not happy that there is no SD Card slot. Since there is a USB 3 port, you can certainly use an external USB hard drive or external SSD drive but still, I'd like to have an SD card slot.The lack of USB-C is also something I don't understand. This is the future of USB and the lack of USB-C seems like a big omission to me.Now let me address my thoughts about the Windows 10s operating system. I'm really conflicted about this. Windows 10s limits your ability to download apps outside of the Store. Microsoft didn't even have Spotify in their Store until recently. I'm encouraged that more and more apps will be added to the Store but am dismayed that some apps that I used to use regularly on my other Windows laptop, iPad and Chromebook, like iTunes, Chrome Browser and YouTube are not available in the Store.Another peculiar obstacle is that you cannot change the default search engine (Bing) that the Microsoft Edge Browser uses. A workaround is to navigate to the search engine of your preference then save that page in a tab and access it from the tab bar when you want to use it.Otherwise there is not that much in Windows 10s that hobbles the laptop. If you want you can upgrade (and later downgrade back to 10s) to the Windows 10 Pro version and have the full windows experience. Also keep in mind that in theory 10s should give you slightly better battery life. The reason given to me by Microsoft Tech is that 10s eliminates certain background processes from occurring which would normally occur with Windows 10 Pro. I've not noticed a measurable difference in my use of the laptop, but I assume that it will depend on what you've installed and how you use your Surface Laptop.Battery life for me is nowhere near the claimed 13.5 hours. Not even close. My previous Windows laptop got only about 3.5 hours so what I'm getting from the Surface Laptop exceeds that greatly. But still, it's not even close to 13.5 hours. On a good day I can eek out maybe 7.5 hours of use before I need to plug into power.UPGRADING TO WINDOWS 10 PRO: After a lengthy debate with myself I took the plunge and upgraded to 10 Pro. It took only 2 minutes. What prompted me to upgrade was another dumbed down feature of 10s that I simply could not live with. 10s does not allow you to access the Command Line. So you are not able to even run the battery test function unless you upgrade to 10 Pro. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Now that I have 10 Pro installed I will be able to definitively report back in a week or so whether it has degraded, improved or has no influence on my battery life.I found an awesome sleeve that I could recommend. It is the Lacdo 11-12"" sleeve and is quite nice, well padded and fits the Surface Laptop absolutely perfectly.Lacdo 11-12 Inch Water Repellent Laptop Sleeve Case for MacBook Air 11.6"" New Macbook 12"" Surface Pro 4 3 Asus Dell HP Ultrabook Notebook Bag, Black",1,2,3,2,4
1218,"Great computer! I got this computer's prior model four years ago and it lasted through me banging my backpack in college 4 years. I was surprised that it could be lightweight and also durable.

1219,"I bought the ASUS machine because I needed a Windows machine to perform some software QA for a site that was developed on a Mac.

It's about half as fast as my Mac, but it did cost an order of magnitude less.I have used it about five hours so far, and the only problems that I had were related to learning Windows 10. I hadn't used a Windows machine in years, and I'd never used Windows 10. But, given that I've had long experience with computers of all types, I adopted rapidly.I haven't used it long enough to find out the veracity of the all-day battery claim, but I'm running it right now on batteries and Windows 10 indicates that it has over a dozen hours to go.Storage space was not that much of a concern for me.

I can't get 4 hours out of a full charge with light tasks like web browsing or typing papers for class, and gaming kills the battery in a ridiculously short amount of time.The display also looks washed out and I cannot find any way to adjust the color or saturation.The build construction feels cheap, though not overly flimsy. Mold lines left on both halves give a sharp edge that needs taken off with an emery board or sandpaper.I enjoy the appearance of the keyboard but it's far overhyped for what it is, a laptop membrane keyboard.In the end it's a $900 laptop that has some decent hardware but fails in almost every other category.",2,0,1,2,2

1240,"<UPDATE>Changing the rating from 3 STARS to 2 STARS due to bad hardware compatibility.I found the cause of the hiccups and inconsistent frame rates as originally stated below. The combination of this Intel Chipset and Nvidia Chipset has reported issues almost like its a bug they can't fix. The 1050 isn't powerful enough to do most of the processing, so the i7 will enter (turbo mode) while your gaming to accommodate the lack of processing power. When this happens, your FPS will drop to a constant 30FPS. Once the switch to turbo is done, your frames will go back to normal. ""Usually took about 30 seconds. and would happen about every minute or so.""HOWEVER: If your game is new enough to where it enters turbo boost and stays in turbo boost - you wont have a problem.

1260,"I hadn't owned a laptop in more than 10 years. I'm a desktop PC person. One of the most important parts of my job is monitoring the shifts in the land under 50+ year old bridges in the Appalachian Mountains. As we've repaired them, the need for someone to be closer to be able to go physically test the land and check them has increased. I live just within 100 miles of all the bridges I monitor but those close to 100 miles away can't just be checked instantly. I go to a hotel about 10 minutes from a cluster of 6 bridges and stay one day and night per week. Guess who tried to take their desktop PC? Yep. I should say I have other interests and uses for the computer too. I am used to being in a house with my mom, my wife, two kids and two puppies. It's lonely at a distant hotel, so I needed something to play my video games on while monitoring. I didn't do as much studying and researching as I normally would on a purchase like this. I have a fairly good grasp and knowledge of computer parts and what I need and don't need.The screen was important but not a deal-breaker since the hotel is a Courtyard and has HDMI televisions that I could connect to. The screen is very nice and I could only see the most stringent of display snobs having a problem with it. I mean no offense to display snobs. I'm an audiophile, I'm a sound snob, we've all got our obsessions. Speaking of the sound, it's okay, nothing more, nothing less. I have a Bose Soundlink Revolve and take it with me, it connects easily to the laptop's bluetooth.When I bought this there seemed to be some questions about the specs, so I've made a short list of the ones I was most interested in:It has the Nvidia GeForce 1060 6GB video card, it plays everything I play very smoothly. I'll go more into that below.It has bluetooth as mentioned above, and AC WiFi, both work very good.The battery life is good for me but I never have it unplugged for more than an hour to two hours. I guess I could have tested that but I rarely think about unplugging it.The keyboard is so nice that I actually use it instead of plugging a USB keyboard in but I did buy the Logitech smaller wireless keyboard (Logitech MK360) and mouse set just to be safe. Trackpad works well too but I prefer a mouse. Don't hold that against the laptop. I've used a laptop maybe 1 year total in my life and have used a desktop PC for more than 20. I'm just not that used to the trackpad. The keyboard and trackpad are backlit with a red color, it's non-offensive and non-glaring and helps a lot if you like to use it in the dark.It has a Solid State Drive that had around 80 GB of free space upon booting it the first time. It's used for your Windows which gives you a fast bootup. It also has a Hard Disc Drive that has 920 GB of free space upon booting it the first time. It takes less than 10 seconds for me to go from pushing the power button, signing in to being on the desktop. That's very comparable to my high-end desktop PC.There's an HDMI 2.0a, a USB-C Thunderbolt and three more 3.1 USB (those work with the older USB versions, if wondering).It has 8 GB of RAM, it can be upgraded to 32 GB and is very simple to upgrade if you need more RAM.This laptop either met every need I had or surpassed the amount I needed. The video card is a bonus to me. I don't play the newest games and usually prefer console versions. I will say I can play Morrowind with graphics overhaul with no problem on this laptop. I also can play Fallout 4 on it with no problems. And what I've been mainly doing is using it to play games through PS Now, it runs those perfectly. I don't get any of the noise, I'm guessing I'm not pushing the card that hard but will say it's very comparable to my PC at home that has a GeForce 980 GTX in it. And I'm again guessing that's because these games I play aren't very stressful on the GPU. The 980 GTX is rated quite a bit better in benchmark tests but take it from me, unless you're playing the very newest games on ultra settings, you're not going to notice. I spent 3 months buying that PC with the 980 GTX and can say I don't think I've ever come close to using all the power it has.Which makes this a great ""work"" computer! I do use a few programs for work that this laptop handles easily. I'll also mention that there wasn't much bloatware on it. And by the way, Cortana is not disabled when you first setup the laptop so be aware. I plugged it in and turned it on, went to the bathroom, came out and heard someone talking. It was Cortana. I'm also one of the people who really likes Windows 10 and it works well on this laptop.I can't find a single fault with it. Unless I wanted to complain about the sound but what do you expect from a laptop? I would normally say whether it's overpowered for some people or underpowered for others but I think those looking at it are probably like me and thinking about some gaming use. I will upgrade the RAM eventually, probably in summer but it's really not needed yet. All in all, I think for the price, the video card, the good dual hard drive format, it's about as good as you can ask for.Look at that, I forgot to mention it doesn't have a disc/optical drive. I really planned it that way since I didn't even notice it until a few weeks of using it. That might be a downside to some, so make note of that. I have a USB disc drive if I need to use a disc but haven't in at least a year. And guess I should mention that it's well-built, might be a hair heavy for some. My daughter used it one day and said it felt like a triple version of her laptop. Dell did a nice job with this laptop.",1,0,5,2,2

In my country, a laptop with these and other specs cost like 300 to 400 bucks more or less. Is ironic that buying it at amazon and even paying a delivery company internatinal shipping fee, is way cheaper than buying it at home.The tablet option comes pretty handy when using media.

1284,"I've been a devoted Windows user since the early 90s. In parallel, and in counterpoint, I've also cycled through countless Windows laptops over the years, including Compaq, HP and Dell, and often been disappointed with the longevity of the machines. I nevertheless retained my affinity for the Windows operating system---so much so that when I purchased a MacBook Pro last year, I partitioned the disk and continued operating under Windows 10. I therefore greeted news of the Surface Laptop this spring---with its sleek and unitary design, and integration with other Microsoft products---with great enthusiasm. At last, I thought, the hardware would rise to the level of the software. The Surface Laptop would be Microsoft's answer to Apple.Alas, upon buying the machine (indeed, the highest-end model), I found myself severely disappointed.First of all, it ran noisy and hot right out of the box. Second, I could not even obtain a full-screen display on a standard Samsung external monitor (a defect which could not be resolved through a lengthy call to Microsoft Tech Support). How could Microsoft overlook such a basic requirement?After several hours of struggling I put the machine back in the box and returned it for a full refund.

They offered to ""fix"" my laptop but they had to have it for 14 business days which wasn't going to happen since I needed a laptop. They then proceeded to simply stop emailing me back which is when I decided to just return it and pick a different company.It's really a shame since the laptop itself is fine.

Everything (in this Windows 10 software) is organized so well-It isn't heavy so it's easier to carry-The screen is bright-The keyboard is comfortable and has the comfortable, convenient and useful Numpad at the right-With its specs it can handle all games that are not too powerfulMy previous laptop cost a bit under $400 that I've bought in 2012 and didn't have all these pros. For $279.99 and even $379.99, but especially the former, this is much better laptop for its price- including adjusted for technological differences in 2012 and 2017.I really don't see any cons... except maybe a slightly weak battery. But I have dealt with it by using power/battery saver mode. On battery at that mode lasts over 3 hours (like nearly 4 hours) which is enough for me.About what kinds of video games it can run:It can't run Ni No Kuni 2 but it can run Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst and Tales of Zestiria on minimum specs. Naruto, or both of those games, require 1 GB/1024 MBs Dedicated Video RAM for Recommended run but this computer has only 512 MBs Dedicated Video RAM.",1,4,1,3,2

The ports leave a lot to be desired but isn't a deal breaker. Although I have yet to confirm true daily performance and battery life, so far it has been overwhelmingly positive. I only felt this when I had ordered the Dell XPS ultrathin but was quickly reminded of its deal breaking limitations.You'll want to show this off and will equally enjoy using it as your daily driver.

Excellent screen viewable from all angles and at least 10' away with colors still looking the same even at 45 degree angle and over 6' away. Keyboard feels awesome, very tactile with a nice feel to know when you activate a key. Sound is at least average, but I usually use headphones which get plenty loud too. It's not filled with bloatware which is a nice surprise, does have software preloaded but it's things people might actually use like Office, Polaris Office and some gaming stuff which is reasonable as people are likely to use this for gaming. The build feels solid and there's just a fraction of an inch of lift from the bottom when lifting just the lid. I like the arrow keys are shifted down just a bit to make them easier to find/use. Track pad feels really smooth and nice to use, it looks like it doesn't have dedicated left/right but it does they are just recessed and surprisingly easy to use and feel great.Not a fan of red back lit keyboard, but red seems to be the color of the moment and you can turn it off, which is great in a lit area otherwise you better know where your keys are. My one complaint is there's no End key outside of the one on the Numberpad with Num Lock off. I use it a lot in both typing and spreadsheets to get around with just the keyboard. There is still the End on the Num pad, but that's Num Lock off, End, Num Lock on (to avoid future errors especially which spreadsheets).

1314,"First off, let me share my wife's testimony, ""This is the laptop of my dreams."" She's the one using it most these days, and has had a few clunkers over the years, so is thrilled by how well this works. I use it on occasion too, and I'm also the one who set it up, and deals with tech issues in our house. First, the two (literally just these two) complaints: the vent near the bottom back can get pretty hot if it's on your lap and if it's on your lap and you open it up, the screen might pinch your thighs. Other than those, this is really flawless for its purpose. Some have critiqued it for not allowing upgrades or personal fixing, which I get as I've repaired more than a few laptop hardware issues. But, very few people have an interest or capability for doing that, and the tradeoff is how thin and light this is.It's not a gaming laptop, it's a productivity laptop and for that, it's wonderful. My personal main laptop is aDell XPS9350-10673SLV 13.3"" 3200x1800 Laptop (Intel Core i7-6560U 2.2GHz Processor, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SDD, Windows 10 Microsoft Signature Image) Silver, and that's what I'm comparing this Surface laptop to. I have pictures which show the relative size. The Surface is more square, providing a larger overall screen, it's also thinner and lighter, not surprising given that it doesn't have near the same specs as the Dell. That said, my Dell is mostly overkill as I tend to keep the resolution on it from max because it's too much for too small of a space for most things (except watching movies) and it has a mediocre battery. The Surface keeps up with almost every task, and if it can't match the Dell 13 on heavy demands, that's not a problem most of the time. The reality of the Surface is that it works, it worked great out of the box, with easy set-up, and continues to be an entirely problem free experience. I would echo the recommendation of others to do the free upgrade from the Windows 10S that this comes with to get it to the regular Windows 10. A few minutes of extra setup time can save some bother and allow more freedom later on. Painless to do, as was the whole process. My wife uses this for browsing, netflix, and also her work-from-home job of captioning, which requires good video and audio. The audio on this is strong and the video is spectactular. The touch screen works fluidly as does the touchpad. This laptop allows us to use it for what we need it for, in ways that are much more user-friendly than anything else I've used. I still personally prefer my Dell 13 for its larger hard drive and more memory. I also like the Dell for having a USB-C, and am surprised Microsoft decided against that. Battery life is really strong, going all day really. This is a perfect work or school laptop, really allowing to maximize productivity without sacrificing anything. It's not the best for hardcore gaming, but that's not it's purpose. If you need a capable, trustworthy, easy to use laptop, this is a very good choice.",1,2,3,2,4

Took a bunch of time and I had to pay to re-install some software, and then one week later the track pad cut out again. I'm preparing to send it in and at least shipping both ways is covered, but now I'm going to be without my computer for at least two weeks. The trackpad cutting out seems like an issue a couple other users have had based on these reviews, and seeing as it is a problem that presents itself a week or so after it starts working again, I'm really concerned about their ability to resolve this for the long haul. Fingers crossed sending it in works, but these two issues raise some concern for me about the basic quality.

1332,"I bought this laptop as a lightweight secondary computer for traveling. As a result, I have used it lightly over about 14 months since purchase. In everyday use the computer is unable to keep up with basic tasks such as browsing. This machine would probably work well with an older operating system installed, but as bloated as Windows 10 is, it just isn't sufficient. Because Windows 10 updates are not optional, the 32GB hard drive fills with huge updates immediately and this constantly bogs the computer.In additional to performance issues, this machine is just poorly constructed. As I found out the hard way, the screen is unusually delicate. Unfortunately I made the mistake of paying for a new screen instead of cutting my losses. A month later, the screen stopped responding-- it still lights, but won't display anything. The touch pad has never worked well and, somehow, often inputs a right click rather than a left click and vice versa. I have had plenty of glitches, freezes, and crashes despite using the stock configuration with virtually no installations of my own.The benefits of the computer are that it is insanely light and has excellent battery life-- at least the advertised 10hrs if not more. I can put it to sleep and leave it in my bag for a week and open it up again with plenty of charge left.

Just run it for now, the display is great without spot and everything looks smooth, nice shot!",3,2,5,4,6
1334,Nice product,1,0,1,2,2
1335,The proccessor is a bit slow and has trouble streaming HD video at times. I would recomend the Pro version for a bit more.,2,4,5,4,5
1336,"Since it is refurbished, I'm assuming the issue before was the keyboard. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I have to restart it, which takes about 5 minutes, otherwise I like it. Runs great, good screen size and sleek.",3,2,5,5,3
1337,"The laptop that I'm reviewing is the E200HA 11.6"" light gold-colored model with 4GB RAM and 32GB storage.(Reviewed on 2/19/2018, Purchased on 5/9/2017)In short, it is a decent laptop that comes standard with Windows 10 and can do basic computing tasks, such as document processing and social media browsing.Here are some of the specific details of the laptop if you're interested:Windows 10 Home 64-bit Operating SystemIntel Atom x5-Z8350 x64-based Quad-core @ 1.44GHz with a max burst frequency up to 1.92 GHz4GB DDR3Intel HD Graphics 400 (integrated chipset)32GB Integrated SSD1366 x 768 max resolutionBluetooth 4.0The laptop's size makes it portable enough to fit inside my backpack's tablet pocket, and its weight is light so I don't have to experience back or shoulder pain. There are two USB 2.0 ports, a microSD card reader, a mini HDMI adapter port, and a 3.5mm headphone port. The trackpad is located in the middle of the laptop so you don't have to deal with strange offset trackpads like other laptops possess. It also comes with Bluetooth so you can connect certain devices, such as wireless headphones or your smartphone.I'm someone who is 5'6"", slightly overweight, and has slightly larger hands, so the keys are a little small compared to, say, an average-sized MacBook. The function keys are about half in size than the regularly sized keys, but the spacebar is reasonably-sized enough without hitting another key.In terms of performance, the laptop is sufficient enough to load web pages in a timely manner. I use Firefox because of its light RAM usage compared to Chrome. YouTube videos will play without crashing the computer, but do take note that if you're watching a 60 FPS video at 720p, you might experience some slowdown. For safe measure, I'd stick with 480p. High resolution 60FPS YouTube videos are absolute resource hogs, especially on Chrome.I don't use Microsoft Office on this laptop, so I resort to using Google Drive. It's performance is sub-par, as it takes more than a few seconds to completely load a document, depending on its contents. If it's a page, it might take a few seconds. If it's a long research paper, it might take longer than a few seconds or so. The same can be said for slides and spreadsheets.The battery life (according to mine after over a year of usage) can reach up to 11 hours with the brightness set at 75% without any running programs. If you're using Chrome or Firefox with a few tabs open and background apps, you might be able to squeeze out, at most, 8 hours, which is enough to go about my day as a college student.With the computer's specifications, do not buy this laptop expecting that you can play GTA5 or Overwatch. This is not, by any means, a gaming laptop. If you want to play video games on a laptop like this, you're better suited for very low-end games, such as Old-School RuneScape, Minecraft, Classic Doom series, or any old-school games from GOG. I haven't tested many games, primarily because of the storage limitations. The specs are faster than what was in the 90's, but it doesn't even compare to a high-end PC with an 8th-gen i7 and a GTX 10-series card, let alone the cheapest MacBook from Apple right now. You can run Rainmeter in the background and it won't burn out your laptop but try to animate a first-person rig for an FPS game and it'll most likely crash.The storage is my biggest problem with this laptop as of right now. Windows 10 requires at least 12 GB to function properly, so you absolutely cannot delete any of those files. Next, if you purchased this laptop straight from ASUS, you can expect there to be some bloatware (or useless programs installed by the manufacturer). That is already an additional, say, 1 or 2 GB. If you decide to install Microsoft Office, that takes up an additional 3 or 4 GB. So, by the end of all that, you're left with at least 10 GB of storage, if not less. It seems like enough for basic tasks, but don't expect to carry all of your favorite television series or videos you want to watch later. It's enough to store a ton of images, but definitely not movies or full TV series at a high resolution. Unfortunately, Windows updates will also use that storage, and depending on the update, it could be costly. I'd carry an additional flash drive or even an external drive if you're going to carry around tons of important data.All in all, I paid $240 for this laptop which, honestly, was a bit much considering its original price ($40 more than the MSRP). However, if you're on a super-tight budget and require a cheap laptop for basic tasks, I can say the little 11-inch computer can do what you need to do. If you're not sure on what to buy for a laptop but have no budget limits, I'd buy a MacBook. If you don't want to purchase a MacBook, I'd take the time to research into Windows 10 laptops and figure out what's best for what you want.I mean, hey if you want to look rich, the laptop looks like a MacBook if you buy the light gold-colored model.",3,1,5,4,3
1338,The size was exactly what I was looking for but the memory was very low,3,4,5,4,3

1346,"This laptop is was so cool. I was able to multi task while working online as an ESL teacher. I can run a lot of application and it responded really fast. It can also get the highest internet connection from the broadband. It is really lightweight and the sound it was loud, louder than my old hp notebook.It was more than what I was expecting for. It even has an automatic installment of windows and there was like a bot that recognizes my voice the first to help me with the installation of the windows. I thought its gonna be hard to use the windows 10 but I was mistaken. It can also sustain a gameplay especially in LoL.One thing that disappointed me was the longetivity of the battery which was stated like ""8h battery life (full working day)"" but the charge is only lasting for 4hrs. NOTE: The battery is not detachable.By the way, I appreciated amazon in giving back the express fee I spent for this, since it had a delay in the delivery.",2,0,1,2,2
1347,"The Pros: It comes well-packaged. Setup is easy, though it takes time It seems to be made of good materialsThe Cons: It ran abysmally slow until I went into settings and manually had Windows 10 index all the files The keyboard layout could be better, with better placement of the arrow keys The keyboard is of poor quality. I'm a touch typist, and sometimes I have to hit a key twice to get it to register The function keys are poorly labeled Even after indexing, it seems to run slower than I would expect of a gaming laptop The screen resolution should be higher for the price",2,1,1,2,2
1348,"First let me say that I spent time trying to find exactly what I was looking for. I was nervous about the restocking fees at Amazon if I wasn't happy with it, so the decision weighed heavy. I have an 11 year old that I was looking for a computer for. I wanted something smaller than a regular laptop so it would be the right size for him. I also, since he is 11, did not want to spend a great deal of money. Funnily enough, I could find many 15.6 inch laptops for around $200, but anything smaller fell into the ones that could twist around and become tablets and such and were therefore crazy expensive. I tried the Lenovo Flex 3, but it only had 2GB of RAM and couldn't even load a webpage without spiking the memory to 100. So i saw this and reminded me of a Netbook. I was never really an anti-netbook person because I knew what they were for and what they weren't. So I bought this and used the Google extensions suggested in another review, and my son has been extremely happy with it. It loads every page he wants and allows him to type papers and such (I am using Google suite to save the limited space this has). Also, the size is perfect for him. So for under $200 with the 4GB of RAM, this has been exactly what I needed. If you want a multiple position one with a touchscreen, then this would not be for you, but still accept nothing short of 4GB of RAM and just know that you will pay more for those features.",3,1,5,4,3
1349,"This laptop computer was purchased for my daughter to take back to college. Her old one had a cracked screen and she saw this. She loves that it is smaller,more compact than her last.",3,1,5,4,3
1350,Runs as advertised but had to reset windows 10 and needed to look at outside website to find the the key buttons to access repair mode for windows 10. Its good for 1080p but 15 in screen not like any higher resolution is necessary.Acer needs better instruction manual. It plays fine just laptop fan to keep it cool. First laptop bought in 9 years,2,0,3,2,2
1351,"First let me say that I love Chromebooks in general. I have owned several of them: Acers, an earlier Samsung, Toshiba, etc. It's a wonderful platform and I recommend them highly. However, the Samsung Plus has been the worst of all of the Chromebooks that I have owned, unfortunately.It has been the most troublesome, from a hardware standpoint, compared to any of the earlier Chromebooks. It crashes regularly; at least once a day. It just shuts off and reboots. While rebooting itself is fairly quick, it takes a long time to reload my Chrome tabs. The shutdowns seem to be random: at one point if I close a tab it will crash, at another point if I just click on web page it will crash. It does run apps okay, some better than others of course, but in general I have not found the apps to be incredibly useful. The native capabilities of a Chromebook are good enough to where the apps are not something that I find incredibly useful so far. The other thing that I find annoying is the flip part of this design. Yes, you can make it tent, or make it be in tablet mode, but there is really no good place to hold the computer while doing this. If you try and grasp it by one of the upper corners you can close the Chrome browser, which is very irritating because you have to reboot the computer to get your tabs back; if you just reopen the Chrome browser you're presented with a blank tab and all of your previously open tabs, while in history, are no longer displayed. Also, when in tablet mode if you try to pick up the computer or grasp it you have to pretty much touch the screen, which can cause all sorts of unintended havoc. So for the next Chromebook that I get I think that I will forgo the flip part of the design because it really doesn't add that much and can make the computer very irritating to operate. Also I find that the computer is not particularly fast. I realize that part of this is that I don't have a broadband connection, just an ADSL connection, so it may be better if you are connected to a much faster service provider than I'm able to acquire. I do like the the precision of the pen and think its one of the best things about this model. The metal case looks nice and premium when new, but it does dent rather than just deflect like the plastic cases do, so that it looks a bit beat up after just a couple of months.Overall I do not think that this is quite ready for primetime, at least not for me. The premium cost is not really justified in my situation and I rather regret this purchase.",2,4,5,4,5
1352,"Wow, was not expecting this. As a bit of a techy, I'm picky when it comes to electronics, especially laptops. If something lags, or is generally not up to my standards, I will not hesitate to return the product. The Asus E200HA runs absolutely incredibly. The 4GBs of RAM really comes in handy, so if you get this laptop, make sure the model has 4GB of RAM. The process is good enough, I say that because the laptop is $199, what more could you ask for. The processor has not shown to make the laptop lag, stutter, or wait for it to catch up, definitely impressed with it. The build quality on this thing is ridiculous. Better made than my thousand dollar HP Envy. The speakers are also not bad, similar to the processor. Overall, this is a TRUE 5 star product. If it's available, get it.",3,1,5,4,3

1355,"Not a verified purchase, but from others' descriptions I wanted to add info that might be helpful. This appears to be a ""Grade C"" used computer. Unsure about the ""certified refurbished"" part, but NewEgg is selling the same one right now, and they note that they're ""Grade C: C grade refers to an item that may have cosmetic damages. Scratch and Dent products are systems with considerable cosmetic blemishes that do not affect performance.

The laptop itself/battery must not be any good- after only 5 months of light use, this is very disappointing. Buyer beware.",3,4,5,5,6
1357,"Overall it's a very nice laptop -- light, thin, with a very nice screen and a great keyboard. I'll just mention one downside: the i7 version gets HOT, uncomfortably hot to leave it on your lap (especially if you're wearing shorts!). I'll look for an option to slow the processor while I'm running it on battery, which might reduce the heat a bit without killing performance. All thin laptops have this issue, but just wanted to point it out.",1,2,3,2,4
1358,"Used computer under 8 hours and the computer would not charge. Manufacturer told me to send it back. Used NEW one for under 8 hours and had the same problem. What junk! They didn't even seem to be concerned, it seemed like a normal issue for them. What a waste of time and money.",2,2,1,2,2
1359,"Excellent Valuepros:-pretty much what everyone is saying, amazing performance for the priceno brainer to buy this instead of building a mid-high range gaming rig due to volatile graphics card market. Buying a desktop GTX 1060 6GB will cost you about 60% of the cost of this laptop.- Max-Q technology. This makes the 1060 about 15-20% slower than the full sized desktop version but it only uses 60 watts. NEVER overheats.- m.2 boot- does not look like a gaming laptop, can bring it to workcons:- display is too dim and doesn't have the best color accuracy for IPS- don't waste your time buying the option with the 5400rpm storage drive like i did, it's just far too slow- keyboard isn't greatFINAL THOUGHTS:I know the i5 version is cheapest, and I have to admit it performs very well.

1360,"After a couple of bad experiences with a competitive laptop, I decided to go for the new Microsoft Surface Laptop. I basically work over the Internet, work with Office 365 and keep absolutely nothing on my laptop.... everything is kept off the machine on an external drive. Because of that I decided to go for the i5, 4 GB, 128 Gig model. I felt it would be more than adequate for what I do... and I was right. I am by no means a ""power user"" that has multiple apps or programs open at the same time. If that is you, then I would recommend getting the i5, 8GB, 256 Gig SSD model. But that is just not me, so the base model works great for me.First of all, lets get out of the way the design, quality of build and the rather unique alcantara fabric keyboard and deck covering.... it's all top drawer. This is built like a tank, yet its in a form factor that is very thin and compact. Simply put, its a beautiful laptop. The keyboard is excellent with a good amount of key travel and they are comfortable to use. The track pad is as good as any I have used on a Windows machine. No, its not the glass type that you find on an Apple MacBook Pro... but that's ok. I personally don't use the track pad anyway... so not a big deal for me. The keyboard is back-lit and easy to work with in low light conditions.I do a lot of live streaming of content over Xfinity and this screen is as good as my MacBook Pro with Retina screen. I actually like this a bit better. The picture quality is crisp and colors are sharp and precise. It is covered in Gorilla Glass 3 so will be highly reflective if you have a light in front of it or outside in the open daylight. None -the-less, it's a beautiful screen and certainly at the top of it's class.The only drawback for some might be the lack of connectors and SD Card slot. The machine comes with a USB 3.0, 3.5mm Headset jack, mini DisplayPort and Surface Connect. I like the Surface Connect Power plug as it is somewhat similar to the old Apple magnetic connector... if you happen to hit it, it pops out without doing damage to the connector. Sadly, Apple did away with that on the latest version of the MacBook products. That said, I can see where I am going to have to buy a couple of dongles for connecting to various peripherals.The Surface Laptop comes loaded with Windows S... which is useless if you want to download any apps that aren't on the Microsoft Store site... like iTunes. You have the ability to upgrade to a 1 year free subscription of Windows Pro. It's $49 annually after the first year. I have no clue why Microsoft would sell their newest, higher end, laptop with Windows S. Maybe they will simply give in and allow everyone to upgrade and forget the annual fee. One can only hope. I upgraded of course and will continue to use Windows Pro.I guess the long and short of it is that I am just a regular guy (a Consultant) that uses his laptop everyday for everyday types of tasks. I don't do complex design, art or mathematical work on the machine with numerous applications open at the same time. As I stated earlier, that is just not me. This laptop is simply put, the best laptop I have ever had. It is a beautiful, well built, technologically strong machine that will serve me well for a number of years. I can't recommend this enough. It is a real winner and Microsoft has hit a home run without question.",0,2,3,2,4
1361,The computer stopped working little after the 30 day period. DO NOT BUY,3,2,5,4,3
1362,"Got the 14 inch, model 81C90009US and been using since end Jan 2018. This is a super high value laptop, in that you get a ton of capability and expandability for your money while being able to run all the latest generations of hardware: 8th gen Intel i5 with 4 DISCREET cores plus hyperthreading, DDR 4 RAM, and PCIe M.2 SSD. Did tons of research, bought and returned two other models before settling on the Flex5.My situation is that I recently retired so had to give up my work laptops and get something personal. Have been a table PC user since 2004, so tablet PC form factor and functionality were a requirement. While I could afford a pretty wide range of laptops, other requirements guided me to the Flex 5, specifically, touch screen, good active digitizer, the 14"" size, and the PCIe M.2 + 2.5""SSD storage options all combined with an 8th gen Intel processor. This COMBINATION of features and FLEXIBILITY is very hard to find, Lenovo really nailed it with the Flex5 at an outstanding price!Quick list of the Positives and Negatives, then more details and benchmarks below...Positives:+Tablet PC form factor (standard laptop, tent, tablet with touch and pen) with far above average performance and upgrade flexibility for the price.+Both PCIe M.2 and SATA SSD slots mean you can put a ton of very fast storage in this relatively compact machine.+8th gen Intel Core i5-8250U provides 8 total threads of processing on 4 physical cores plus hyperthreading, a very low base clock of 1.6 GHz for power saving, a 3.4 GHz Turbo for power when needed, and a nice low 15w total power dissipation for both battery life and running cool. My experience is that some generations of Intel procs are smaller steps, some bigger, and the 8th gen is one of the bigger steps in speed and efficiency.+Great battery life, I regularly get 5-6 hours, more than enough for my usage style, and very good overall for all the power on tap, display size, etc.+14"" screen is the optimum size for me personally. I've owned everything from 10""-17"" laptops, and 14"" is the sweet spot for me. This screen is HD resolution of 1920x1080, which is fine for my use on the road or away from the desk. I've had a QHD external monitor, and that is fun, and where I'd put my money if I needed more resolution. I dock and have three HD screens, though, so that's enough for me.+Touch is extremely reliable and configurable. Digitizer for the pen is Wacom, so it is OUTSTANDING for note taking, a key requirement for me. The Lenovo Active Pen that comes with this config of the Flex5 is actually very good. I've got a drawer with about 30 different active and passive styli I've used over the years, and this is one of the better ones. It's also a good value at twenty six bucks. I bought three extras, one for each of my travel cases plus the one in the holder that slides into the usb port on the Flex.Lenovo Active Capacity Pens for Touchscreen Laptop for Lenovo Yoga 720, Flex 5, Miix 720, Miix 510 and Yoga 900s Laptops - GX80K32882.+Just enough ports. With three USB3 on hand, two type A and one type C, I can do most of what I want and need directly connecting to the laptop when away from the desk. See docking details under Connections, below. The HDMI port is FULL SIZE, thank goodness, simplifying connections on the road, and the SDXC slot is also full size, meaning easier connections to all that SDXC storage I have from multiple generations of cameras, etc.+802.11AC wifi built in. My home is all multi channel AC, so this is nice from a speed stand point.+Expandable RAM. I replaced the 8GB stick with 16GB CrucialCrucial ME CT16G4SFD8266 16G DDR4 2666MT s CL19 DR x8 Unbuffered SODIMM Retail, provides a nice bit of RAM headroom when using demanding programs or many programs.+Finger print reader is fast, reliable, and works extremely well with Windows 10.+Backlit keyboard is a real boon in low/no light.Negatives-The screen is just barely bright enough to use in a sunlit room, and washes out when outdoors in sunlight. I have a sun room where I use the Flex5 sometimes, and have to max the brightness and be sure I don't have direct sunlight on the screen to get a good viewing experience. It's ok overall, but I would have liked a little more headroom on the screen brightness for these sunny occasions. Indoors normal lighting is no issue.-The power connector is 4.0x1.7mm barrel connector, different than the other THREE Lenovo/ThinkPad connectors I've used previously, so a bit of adapting was in order to use the 19v and 20v laptop powerbricks I already owned. Worked out, see details below under Connections.-The SDXC card slot only takes in about half of the card length, meaning no leaving a card in the slot all the time.Combined, these three negatives were not worth a whole star given the strong and almost unique combination of positives, so 5 stars from me. Highly recommended stock for the price, and as a platform to build out a high storage laptop with very good performance across the board.DETAILS:*********Storage: 5TB total as I configured it.*********I have a TON of stuff I like to keep on my laptop, and needed over 2TB capacity. Since PCIe M.2 maxes out at 2TB right now, and those 2TB PCIe drives are very expensive per GB, that meant I needed something with two storage options, OR just a 2.5"" SSD option (I already owned a 4 TB Samsung 2.5 SSD and wanted to use itSamsung 850 EVO 4TB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E4T0B/AM)) .With the Flex5, I decided I go with a good fast 1TB PCIe M.2 SSD as the boot drive, theSamsung 960 EVO Series - 1TB PCIe NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD (MZ-V6E1T0BW), and then use my 4TB 2.5"" SSD as the data drive. I imaged the included 128GB M.2 SSD to the new 1TB M.2 BEFORE I even turned on the laptop for the first time using Acronis and my desktop PC, that way, no concerns about drive Id's etc. Worked like a charm.*********Connections*********Connections on the laptop are: Power - 4.0x1.7mm barrel barrel connector for 20v power supply, 1 full size HDMI out, 1 3.5mm stereo jack for speakers. USB is 2x USB 3 type A, one type C. For a docking station I'm using thePlugable USB 3.0 Universal Laptop Docking Station for Windows (Dual Video HDMI & DVI / VGA, Gigabit Ethernet, Audio, 6 USB Ports). Have this connected to the USB C port. Have a monitor connected to the Dock via HDMI, and another to the HDMI out on the Flex5, for a total of 3 monitors including the Flex5 screen when docked. I run my audio out of the dock as well for convenience, vs. having another wire to connect to the laptop. The size of the power input is different than the other THREE Lenovo types I've owned and used before, so I just bought a bunch of 5.5x2.1mm to 4.0x1.7mm barrel adaptersDC Power Converter Plug, Conwork 5-Pack (5.5mm x 2.1mm to 3.5mm x 1.35mm) Tip Size AC/DC Adapter Barrel Plug Connector for Wall ChargersDC Power Converter Plug, Conwork 5-Pack (5.5mm x 2.1mm to 3.5mm x 1.35mm) Tip Size AC/DC Adapter Barrel Plug Connector for Wall Chargersand used some of the many 19v and 20v chargers I had laying around.

It took about 5 hours to update to the latest version.-Compared to the C300, this laptop's power cord cable seems a little thinner. I'll have to make sure I'm not putting too much wear and tear on it.-11.6 inch screen is nice, but small. The keyboard keys are on the smaller side. For extended desk use, I would hook up to a keyboard/mouse/larger screen.-Disk is very small. I managed to free up 14GB of the 28GB available. Do the following to free up more space:*after the major update is complete, go to C drive and use Disk cleanup utility.*if you are exclusively going to be using google apps in the browser, remove the Office trial install to save a little extra space.Pros:-lightweight and portable-screen looks pretty good!-trackpad works pretty well-once the updates are done, laptop works pretty quickly",3,1,5,4,3

Also, with the design when I'm in a public space it doesn't scream GAMER.It's a little heavier than I'd like, but I'm not a fragile old man so it doesn't really bother me. Everything is easily upgradable. Literally one screw pops out and you can reach the hardeive and memory. This will be great for first timers. The screen needs to be replaced.

My last laptop was an Asus that had held up very well and still performs pretty well, so I wanted to stay with a brand that I've been able to rely on. The fingerprint sensor makes logging in a breeze and it stays up from the scan nearly instantly. Occasionally there is a little lag but nothing to bad. This has everything I need for my usage and I'll probably never touch more than half the memory but it's nice to have such a large amount of storage just in case.

It is plastic trying to emulate brushed mental. The plastic ridges scratch easily, and the finish looks bad when scratched.Installing all the Windows updates takes very long time and many reboots. Here is how you can speed it up: use the Microsoft media creation tool, and download the installation of the latest version of windows to a USB flash drive.Boot from the USB flash drive; choose fresh install, and delete all existing partitions from internal storage before installing to unallocated space. This will give you the latest version of Windows and the maximum amount of free storage space for future use (whatever tiny it is).Do not worry about drivers; Windows will find them automatically after a reboot or two.",3,4,5,4,3

On the advice from folks that know more than I do about identity theft, I bought it to use as a dedicated machine for our online banking only and nothing else. It has a 32g flash memory, the same thing used in phones and tablets, in place of a serious hard drive. In other words, it uses a multimedia card in place of a drive. Now, the problem with this idea is that 28g of this space is necessary for the operating system. With this setup, there is only 4g left for anything else. It is not only slow, but hasn't enough storage space to update even the operating system. We have very, very minimal software installed; A browser for getting online and the software necessary to pay bills, etc. on line. It is not able to update anything for lack of space to do the work. I can't imagine what this machine could possibly be good for.The only plus in this purchase is that I learned a $200 lesson in emmc theory and operation.

1411,"Acer Aspire 1 a114-31-c4hh Notebook is a light weight, low cost laptop. Its dark charcoal carbonate body is slim and a reasonable size for portability versus yesteryear's models. The 14 inch screen displays an impressive high definition resolution. It has HDMI, USB 3.0 x1 and USB 2.0 x2 ports, headphone port, WiFi (2.4 Ghz and 5G), Bluetooth 4.0 and all the basics one would expect from recent laptops. It comes with 4 gigs of ram and a quad core Celeron N3450, is power efficient, and can bump up to a 2.2 Ghz speed when needed. The graphics, based on Intel technology, are exceptional. The sound-quality of the from the speakers are also impressive  loud, clear and articulated eliminating the need for a side device such as in-line Bluetooth speakers.Windows 10 comes installed on this model. I'm not a big fan of Windows and didn't expect much from its performance-wise (to say the least). That turned out incorrect. I found that Win10 was quite snappy for all basic computing -- office, surfing, streaming. It comes with some bloat like recommended programs and games, but once most of these were uninstalled I was left with about 12 gigs out the box of free hard drive space. Twelve gigs is not much too work with, but this device is designed as a notebook and not an full laptop. I therefore use an SD in for storage.The battery power is better than average, giving many hours of use and virtually no loss during sleep/standby. If this had a number pad, it may have scored higher with me in the office use experience (bad for number crunchers), but the keys are laid out comfortably with great space between each key. One notable deficit in this Acer, however, is very slow downloads over WiFi. I compared its download speeds via WiFi with those of other notebooks and computers in my home to the detriment of the Acer. Fortunately the Acer has a Ethernet I use for great speeds via that connection.I highly recommend this machine for professional types and people who want a reliable device that provides all the essentials of everyday computing need. I would rank it as a particularly good choice for those on a budget  it performs at the level of a more expensive machine. It's not for those who expect more internal space for",3,4,5,4,3

So I thought I'd buy a 256gig SD card and turn that into a data drive. The way the slot is configured, half of the card sticks out. (It's the same way on my ASUS laptop, too, so I don't know if I can blame Acer for this, but it's a clumsy design decision for a fraction of an inch.)The laptop is about half the weight of my Asus laptop, so, really, the only thing I can think that this laptop is useful for is to surf the web in a coffee shop or something. Maybe also to take notes in a class. The keyboard has an undesirable flex to it, so I'm not sure how much you could use it for serious typing though.It really doesn't seem to be capable of running any other application.",3,4,5,4,3

I just use it to buy more stuff I don't need on Amazon and write papers in Word. Maybe watch the occasional video. Pretty simple use so I don't know how it would handle a bigger workload.The extra hard drive is cool. Again I don't know much about computers so I just kinda have it but I'm sure if I ever wanted to download large files or anything that would be super convenient.The biometrics part is nice. You can only have one registered print so it has to be the same finger in the same spot every time which is probably my biggest complaint. I might be spoiled because my phone has I think 5 registered fingerprints so I can be in a different position or use my left hand if I want, where on this computer I can't.But I definitely like it.

I needed a secondary laptop that would last 8+ hours for basic tasks like web browsing and writing and this fits that bill quite nicely. Already own a $1300 Gaming laptop but it only lasts 4 hours on basic tasks even with Nvidia Optimus on board.I switched over to Linux since 32gb is just NOT enough space for Windows partically if you get Major updates like the Fall Creators Update and the laptop was made before it even came out so you would have to reinstall using a brand new ISO from Microsoft but if you do you are going to lose the Acer software so I just said nope $200 is plenty for a Linux machine since I ain't running games and the like that require Windows.

The keyboard feels super nice, the track pad is big and is very accurate, and even the ASUS logo looks super high end. I also like how the speakers played music from youtube, and the online web browsing was fast out of the box. Overall this thing is great and I plan to use it a long time.

1435,"I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter. She loves it! I like that is perfect for her to use for schoolwork, and she likes that it is great for gaming and youtube. Graphics are good, sound is good. This is a great little machine for the price.",2,4,5,4,3
1436,I bought it for my daughter for Christmas,2,2,5,4,2
1437,its a nice laptop all and all. I did expect it to be a bit faster. i still dont have any programs only photoshop and sometimes it gets slow whe working on PS. I hope it doesn't get worse in time. Other than that its a pretty nice laptop.Another thing i dont really like is the material the use for it. The finger get market everywhere.,2,2,1,2,2

1439,"Right out of the box, this laptop hangs, hesitates or freezes. The system seems to hesitate, every few minutes, for anywhere from 5 seconds to several minutes. You get the ""busy"" spinning circle, and nothing responds. We are returning this asap, as this laptop is unusable in this condition. Will be ordering a different brand.",1,0,1,2,2
1440,"Very good laptop. There are a lot more better laptops out there, but this was the best for quality/price. I'm happy with this purchase.",1,2,3,2,4
1441,"I've had this computer for at least three days now, so far it has not given me any trouble at all (will update if it does). However, if you want to use your laptop right away I recommend turning it on and leaving the update for windows 10 overnight, since it takes at least half a day to update. I don't play too many games on the PC, I just wanted a computer that would run my game well, but I was honestly impressed by the display and quality. The graphics look amazing and I can run my game smoothly while using high settings. The keyboard is comfortable to use as well, which is another bonus, and for those that don't like the red keyboard light you can turn it off or adjust the brightness. The fan does make a lot of noise when you're playing games (any gaming computer does that at this point), but when you're doing work or searching the web it does not make any noise at all. If you're just wanting a computer to play a couple of games, do work, or search the web then this one is for you. It's also not extremely over budget like the rest! To be honest, you're paying for less and getting a lot.",1,0,1,2,2
1442,"Nine hours of battery life, runs Windows 10, and is capable of running Android Studio and building Android apps. If you're looking to take light productivity (presentations, writing, blogging, programming, etc.) wherever you go, and counting on it to have enough battery to get something done on a whim, there is simply no better choice.Obviously you get what you pay for, and you're not buying a computer that plays the latest & greatest video games, nor will it do you any good for professional video editing, but if you have a workstation and feel like remoting in to get work done, this product is going to be your favorite at this price point.1080p screen  Plenty of screen estateFanless  It doesn't run hot enough to need oneBattery life  Will last longer than it takes Tool to release their next albumThin and light  Just stick it in a sleeve and throw it in your bag",3,4,5,4,3

1447,"The Chromebook itself is lovely! My daughter loved it, however the display went off totally after 2 months of use and wouldn't ever come back on, so we had to return it.",2,2,5,4,3
1448,Once set up everything worked fine and the OS worked well but ultimately returned due to this laptops abnormally large size and overall flimsy plastic feel & framing. If your looking for a commuter/business/on-the-go laptop this is not what you want due to the size and structure.,2,2,1,2,2
1449,nice computer very light and usable for college,2,2,5,4,6

1454,My Fiance loves it and he uses it everyday.,2,2,5,4,2
1455,"This laptop would be great if the monitor wasn't so terrible. I had backlight bleed watching movies no matter how I set the brightness or contrast. Two of these were defective. I sure hope they don't consider this bleeding acceptable. My 6 year old Asus it replaced has darker black and no spill and it was only about 400 dollars. Too bad. This thing loads fast, is light weight, has plenty of power for work and play, but it's just terrible for doing any work with night charts, movies or anything other than surfing web pages. One computer had problems bleeding from the top left corner, bottom right and center. This one has some bleeding from the bottom left and just right of center. It is distracting and annoying. Completely unacceptable in this day and age. Frustrating as all heck. Thankfully, Amazon customer service processed my rant and is taking good care of me.Honestly, I would not purchase an asus product again after this experience. Quality control is extremely important in technology.",3,3,3,2,4
1456,Performed excellently. Faster than I expected and the 17.3 screen is great even though I'm hooked to a 40 in monitor most of the time.,2,2,0,2,1
1457,"The laptop can run small programs like chrome, YouTube, Netflix, etc. But it can not run big games. Mine doesn't even lock when I close the screen and the fan can be very loud and it sounds like the radioactive detecting sound. I would not recommend because the graphics card is what kills the performance and so does the bad motherboard.",2,3,1,2,2
1458,virtual memory was maxxed out within a week.,2,4,5,4,3
1459,"Great and good looking laptop, but there's only one problem that I assumed everyone (who brought this laptop) is facing with their Lenovo laptop.. LAGGING! This laptop keeps on lagging and I can't figure out why. I went to task manager to check the CPU, but nothing. Everytime when I watch a video on this laptop, it keeps on lagging the video or even sometimes freezes. Lenovo should figure out how to fix this issue as soon as possible. Other than that, the package came with everything (as new) and never had an issue with missing materials.",2,2,1,4,2

1465,"Purchased the product Jan 2018 and satisfied, but there are occasional freezes.",2,2,1,2,3
1466,"I bought this for my wife to replace her older, bulky, HP laptop. It was a few years old and replacement was due. She picked this one out at a retail store and we found it on Amazon for a reduced price. She LOVES it!! So light, fast, and cute because it's her favorite color. The palm rests have a cloth feeling but they are made of some plastic stuff that's easily cleaned, the screen looks great, and the keyboard feels right... partly due to the palm rests allowing a person to rest palms on them while typing. It has a fast hard drive, it's quiet and light. I really don't have negatives to say about it except that it only has a couple of USB 3 ports. That's OK... I bought a tiny USB 3 hub and we're all good now. Definitely recommend this device though it's not cheap.",1,2,3,2,4
1467,"This is my first laptop/Chromebook. I am everything Google, so this works out perfectly! I use a desktop computer and my cell ph mostly, but needed something for downstairs which this works great. It came fully refurbished, clean. Their is 2 scratch marks barely noticeable on the casing, but other than that and for the price of under $150.00 I feel I got an awesome deal.",2,2,5,4,2

1470,"Scary fast and wicked beautiful. I know looks aren't supposed to be a factor, but ... wow. the lid with the red lights behind the lines and the wolf motif, and the keyboard with all the colored lights behind it are gorgeous and very attention getting. It works great. The screen is enourmous and crystal clear. I haven't used the freezy insert for cooling yet, as I have a pretty good fan under it. I downloaded the manual, but haven't looked up yet how to actually use that. This thing is also big and heavy, really pushing the limits of what is portable. It is too large to fit into my existing laptop sleeve. Customer service from Acer is superb, as I had a little lockout issue early on that they resolved over the phone, no problem. Love all the ports for peripherals, my last laptop ran out of USB's after I added the mouse dongle and the fan. I love that I can toggle off and on the touchpad with just a button. Battery lasts me about 3 hours before it needs charging.",2,0,1,0,1
1471,"Great gaming laptop for the money. I'll start out saying i really only play World of Warcraft and a few simple games on steam, but for that purpose, I've found only minor faults with this machine. Wow runs smoothly even in new areas with dense player load, but this is on a custom setting i use that's below ultra but above middle of the road. Pros: great performance for the money, looks good, solid build quality, decent battery. Cons: sound quality through stock speakers is lackluster, keyboard lighting features are basically nonexistent, 1050ti already technically outdated, but solid for the price point, cooling fan is a bit loud. I realize it may sound like im beating up on a computer i gave 5 stars, but I could not find something better for the price.",2,0,3,2,2
1472,"This laptop is really fast.In a few seconds you're ready to go to internet or play games. The only con, the Windows 10 crashed 3 times and you need to start again the laptop, Never had this problem before with my old laptop, besides this and really recommend this model.",1,0,1,2,2
1473,Noted slower performance after 6 months,3,1,5,4,3
1474,I've been a Lenovo fan for years because their more expensive laptops come with beautiful matte or anti-glare screens. This laptop however is not just glossy. It is more of a mirror than a laptop. I can see my reflection in the screen when it is at full brightness!It may be OK if you only work in a dim room with no windows and no bright lights.,3,2,3,2,2
1475,Came in with a broken GPU fan. It is suppose to turn on when you start gaming but mine wouldnt and the GPU would reach 90c which is way too hot. Other than that it was awesome and ran games fine.,2,0,1,2,2
1476,"Overall very good laptop. This is a replacement for a Samsung laptop purchased in 2011.Pros: Build feels very solid and high quality. Has an optical drive, which I do still find useful and was looking for in this purchase. Laptop is not ""flashy"" at all in design--basic black, which is nice if you travel with it and don't want it to attract unwanted attention. Laptop stays cool. Plenty of storage. Screen is good, but contrast could be improved. This is the only laptop I found with every aux port I might need. (Recently spent two weeks in a location where a wired Ethernet connection was still needed to connect to internet). Very little bloatware. So far have found the fan to be quiet, so the laptop is usable in a classroom or business environment without embarrassment of the laptop ""revving.""Cons: The power/charging cord looks and feels extremely flimsy. Just waiting for the wires to break from flexing so much. Biggest problem with this laptop is not the laptop, but Windows 10. Was aware of that when purchasing. It would also make more sense if this ""business"" laptop came with Windows 10 Pro instead of Home version. The 1TB mechanical hard drive runs slow--no improvement in speed between this 2017 laptop and my old 2011. Again, a choice made to prioritize capacity over speed. Keyboard does not have backlight.Things to be aware of: This laptop comes with a trial version of Office 365. The full software is not included and must be purchased separately (or purchase a subscription). Default browser is Microsoft's Bing-powered Edge; IE 11 is onboard and can be set as the default. Windows 10 does not have a ""Windows Easy Transfer"" application, so a work-around or other options are needed if you wish to transfer files from an older laptop.Edit: Be aware that the speakers on this laptop are in the center of the BOTTOM of the unit. Sound quality seems fine as long as laptop is sitting on something.",2,2,1,2,2

1481,"This was a replacement for another Chromebook so the performance was as expected eg. excellent. What pleasantly surprised me , because I hadn't given it any thought , was that all my sites were there complete with remembered passwords. Chromebooks are the best buy for the buck.",2,2,5,4,2
1482,"Surprisingly good for the money!This unit, the (HP Notebook Laptop 15.6 HD Vibrant Display Quad Core AMD E2-7110 CPU 1.8GHz 4GB RAM 500GB HDD DVD Windows 10) is a great starter for any home, student or office. Sporting Windows 10 is a great addon considering other computer offerings down in this price range which offer windows 7 if anything at all.As is, it's good for most tasks including some photo editing and processing. Handles the web and email with ease, simultaneously I might add. Will even run all that while working in Word and using rather large spreadsheets in excel!This unit is versatile and with a few cheap upgrades, will perform exactly like a $1,000.00 laptop.I'd recommend upgrading the ram to 8GB and the hard drive with a small SSD hard drive for speed, or a large fast 7200 rpm notebook drive. Once those are done, you've got something more than capable for almost anything you'd want to do with it.HP as always, great service and support along with great quality that will last you easily 4-6 years if you take care of it. Highly Recommend!",3,1,2,4,2
1483,This is an incredible chromebook.The screen resolution default is not highest it can go but is about 25% - you can scale it all the way up quickly in settings / display settings but may have less battery time.Usb c ports can run generic & apple adapters for flawless hdmi output & usb peripherals. Everything I tried worked instantly even cheap generic ones.The speakers suck & I fear mine may be blown or damaged & poppy just from regular use - a real shame for a 2017 laptop as YouTube & Netflix was a likely use of this.Charges fast & keeps a charge like a champ,2,4,5,4,5
1484,"I paid over $1,500 for this Asus. Had it 15 months. It stopped working. I took it back to Best Buy to get it repaired. I was told it would cost more to have it repaired than to purchase a new one. To bad I paid cash.No recourse. Purchase an Asus at your own risk.",2,2,1,2,2
1485,"Avoid. I purchased this late last year and had nothing but issues from day one. I was finally forced to go through the process in Windows 10 to do a ""reset"". After four hours of the process wiping and reloading Win 10 I went to boot it up today and it is looking for a Bitlocker recovery key although the device was never set up with one. Microsoft hung up on me when I explained the problem. Yes literally hung up after saying in an Indian accent ""call Dell"". Dell is basically giving me the runaraound suggesting a buy a new laptop. I will and it won't be a Dell.... ever again.",2,2,1,2,2
1486,"I hate writing bad reviews for products, but this one should be warned about.I didn't think it was too bad when I first bought it. It seemed like a nice little computer that could do about what I wanted.Out of the box this machine seems to have some sort of issue with the pre-installed windows operating system. It is very slow first off. It took the entire day to get everything ready on the computer.Next was my disliked point. These issues cascaded into the wireless driver, causing the machine to not recognize any wireless internet at all! This would kick me from any game that I would be playing, mess up other things, and give me a hard time. I tried everything to fix this issue, but nothing came about. I shouldn't have to go through these issues with a ""new"" computer.Overall, very slow working even with the i7 processor, and issues galore with the operating system. I would not recommend this buy.",2,0,1,2,2

1489,Received today. No complaints so far. I will update my review if things change.,2,2,5,4,3

1491,"Less than a year old, very lightly used, and the case is falling apart. By lightly used, I mean that it stays in one room, and we use it for netflix, and of course, amazon prime, etc. The power cord wires are separating, and the lid is ready to fall apart. Bought another one just like it, for my son for school, and it has not fared as well.Read all the reviews of how this is just a bad design, so we are not the only people with this problem.Really, this is what happens when a brand is going down. Start building junk, and then blame the customer that they are not opening the lid in the right way, so the screws are falling out. (forgetting to mention that the screws are very small, few, with no loctite.)For me, not a big problem. I have HP laptops that are a few years old and still work great.

1494,"Fantastic laptop. I used an Asus G73 for about 6 years and finally replaced it with the Acer Predator 17 based on my extensive research. Every gaming laptop has some issue that people do not like. This laptop has the ""locked bios issue"" which doesn't really bother me as I may not ever need to upgrade the SSD's. This laptop runs ALL the latest games in the highest settings with no problems. I almost never hear the fans kick on to full. But just a warning, when the fans are on full, you better be using headphones! The frostcore doesn't seen to help too much but as i generally have no need for a DVD, I just leave the frostcore in (the frostcore is included with the laptop). I have only had the laptop for about a month now but so far it has been great and I am extremely happy with this machine, I did NOT receive any discount on this machine for my review. I hope it helps people doing research like when I did.",2,0,1,0,1
1495,"The new 12.3-Inch Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Touchscreen Laptop represents the next phase in the evolution of computing devices based on the Chrome Operating System. This Samsung Chromebook Plus is definitely a five-star computer for any individual who would regularly use both its laptop and tablet modes, who would benefit from the more vertically-oriented and webpage-accommodating 3:2 aspect ratio of its display, who would regularly use its built-in pen as an adjunctive input device, and who would regularly utilize its out-of-the-box accessibility of Android Applications. However, it should be noted, that some reviewers have deducted one or more stars for its somewhat cramped and non-tactile keyboard, its lack of keyboard backlighting at this mid-level price point, its less than rich and robust speakers, and the inevitable glitches in the functionality of the newly-integrated Android Applications in a Chrome OS device. But, to be fair, these areas of concern are highly subjective, and they do not actually detract from the overall computing experience of most users. Other than the exciting prospect of having Android Applications readily available as soon as the Samsung Chromebook Plus is set up, its absolutely bright (400-nits), crisp (234 pixels-per-inch), and beautiful touch-enabled 2400x1600p Quad-HD IPS display, is widely considered to be its premier feature. In fact, the 400-nit display of the Samsung Chromebook Plus is so bright, and it lights up the keyboard so effectively, that the quality of the computing experience is not appreciably lessened by the lack of keyboard backlighting. Of course, for most Chromebook users, the quality of the overall computing experience is largely determined by the power and performance of the processor. This 12.3-Inch Samsung Chromebook Plus unit is powered by the ARM-based 2.0GHz Hexa-Core OP1 processor, with the big.LITTLE configuration, consisting of Dual Cortex-A72 Cores, along with Quad Cortex-A53 Cores. The smaller, less powerful, and less power-consuming Cortex-A53 Cores handle routine computing tasks, whereas the larger, more powerful, and more power-consuming Cortex-A72 Cores are only activated by the operating system when they are required for a more demanding workload. This big.LITTLE power optimization technology facilitates excellent energy efficiency, which results in lengthy battery life and run time. The ARM-based 2.0GHz Hexa-Core OP1 processor, which powers the Samsung Chromebook Plus, provides sufficient capability and performance for mainstream day-to-day productivity and entertainment activities, and can support all but the most extreme levels of multitasking, without noticeable lagging or hesitation. In addition, it renders webpages rapidly, and it provides for smooth scrolling and navigation on content-rich and graphics-heavy websites. For those users who require more capability and performance, it would be prudent to wait for the availability of the Samsung Chromebook Pro, which is almost identical to the Samsung Chromebook Plus, except for the fact that it is equipped with a more powerful Intel Core m3-6Y30 mobile processor. Regarding the other essential characteristics and components of this 12.3-Inch Samsung Chromebook Plus device, it features an understated and elegant platinum silver design, ultra-thin (0.55-inch) and ultra-light (2.4 pounds) aluminum unibody construction, 4GB of system memory, 32GB of eMMC flash storage, two USB-C connectivity ports, one conveniently situated on either side of the device, each with a 5Gbps data transfer rate, a micro-SD card slot, a combined audio jack, 802.11a/c WiFi capability, 2x2 wireless LAN, Bluetooth 4.0, and 4K display out. The battery life of the Samsung Chromebook Plus is approximately eight hours for combined productivity and entertainment activities, which is impressive, considering the increased power requirements of its exceedingly high-resolution display. For users who absolutely must have a backlit keyboard, and who would have little need for Android Applications or a built-in pen, there are other more suitable mid-level Chromebooks that are currently available. However, this new Samsung Chromebook Plus model would be ideal for any Chromebook user for whom a bright, vibrant, and high-resolution display is a priority, for whom its mobile ARM-based processor would provide sufficient power and performance, who regularly utilizes Android Applications, who would regularly utilize its built-in pen for note-taking, drawing, and other forms of input, and whose workflow would not be compromised by its somewhat non-tactile and non-backlit keyboard. In conclusion, this new 12.3-Inch Samsung Chromebook Plus Touchscreen Laptop is an outstanding convertible computer, and it has enough superb features and components to merit a five-star rating, along with a very enthusiastic recommendation.",2,4,5,4,5
1496,"This is an excellent laptop for the money. If you are in need of a gaming laptop at a budget price without it looking too shouty when you take it to class or work, this fits the bill nicely. While the majority of the models out there had TN displays, I lucked out and got the updated IPS unit. The display is crisp and vibrant with great viewing angles. The battery life is fantastic as well for a gaming laptop. During every day work such as web browsing and video viewing I get about 6-7 hours (1.5 - 2 hours while playing games using the Nvidia 1050). It also maintains a relatively slim form factor for what is packed in it. The plastic body and build quality feel excellent and the rubberized finish on the top and sides is a nice touch and helps you hold on it it. The downside is that being all black with this texture makes it a fingerprint magnet. The speakers are surprisingly great. The best I have experienced on any laptop I have owned. The sub woofer gives audio extra depth and punch with the front facing speakers providing great stereo sound. One thing to keep in mind is that the speakers are highly directional, so if you are setting at off angles some of the stereo effect is lost. Some people complained about touchpad issues, but this was rectified by a quick and easy Dell drive update. I bought the SSHD model which really slogged the whole thing down. I would immediately recommend getting the model with the SSD. I placed the 500gb SSD from my previous laptop in it and now it is lightning fast. The gaming performance is solid with most games on high settings at 1080p running at 45-60 fps depending on the title. Overall I think this is the best laptop I have owned thus far. There may be more powerful options out there but the price vs. performance ratio on this cannot be beat.Pros:-Great bang for the buck (mine was $700)-Sturdy build quality-Contemporary looks-Easy to work on and upgrade (8gb model has an open ram slot, mine has an open m.2 slot, only takes one screw to get in the back)-Good IPS panel-Great thermals, does get loud er under full load but not much more than my desktop. When not under load and with an SSD it is silent-Nice keyboard back light-Great battery life-Great speakersCons-Keys on the keyboard could be slightly bigger. I adjusted quickly but not as nice as my old Lenovo-Stock mechanical 5400rpm SSHD is a sloth-Fingerprint magnet",1,0,1,2,2

Great for travel with good battery life . I recommend it !I am back. have been using this computer constantly. I was a little concerned about the 32gb storage but not anymore. I put a 124 GB Samsung micro sd card in it. Went to storage and selected what Will be sent to the Micro SD card. You can select from 5 categories . new... Apps, Documents, music, photo and videos and new movies and TV shows. But keep in mind, most of my photos, videos, Docs are on the cloud. So I have plenty of storage. The OS took up half of the 32gb but that is not bothersomeIMPORTANT GOOD NEWS! When windows 10 upgrades it will temporarily take up 90% of your CD drive. Don't panic IN 10 days all of the old Windows 10 files will automatically be removed from your C drive leaving you with about 11GB of free space. Justv be sure you put your Docs, Photos Etc on your micro SD card or on the cloud such as DROP BOX (I installed 128GB micro SD card) Between Cloud and SD card I only have windows 10 and apps on my C Drive. This works just fine.",3,1,5,4,3

However, I bought another stick of ram for cheaper on eBay of the same type to upgrade to 16gb and it has been able to stream using OBS and various capture cards quite well, on the go especially.or gaming, regardless it has a GTX1050, I feel my GTX960 4gb on my desktop is much more powerful, but it could be that the CPU is throttling the GPU in some cases, however it's possible to play a lot of today's games on medium settings at 60fps which is perfectly fine for me. I really got this laptop for media production, and with the poor panel (TN panel,) it's quite hard to justify color, but you can change the panel for a very cheap price and easy installation.I will say this much though, you can't really get these decent specs for this price range right now, and since they're simply overpricing on a lot of computer parts and packages, I'd say it's the best deal right about now for a mid-high range laptop. Upgrade your ram and possibly an i7, and you've got yourself a portable, powerful workstation for a great price.",1,0,3,2,2

And if it holds up which I think it will, I am walking away from Microsoft with their never ending PROBLEMS and BUGGY PRODUCTS. One thing, Chromebooks don't have DVD/CD Drives or Hard Drives (a Negative and a Positive) but they offer abundant Cloud Storage (a Positive and a Negative). No Drives means very few moving parts to break and very little heat to dissipate...I don't think they even have fans! Well, I am willing to spend $188 to test out this alternative path from MS which I have been searching for for years, Chromebooks have no Operating System other than the Chrome Browser.

1516,"working fine, all I expected ,time will tell",2,2,5,4,2
1517,"EDIT: I've kicked off the return process after running into a situation where Chrome literally blacks out the screen when running. Means the graphics card simply can't handle it, which is a dealbreaker. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Book from Verizon and it's much more my speed.Because I AM tech savvy - been messing with computers in some form since I was in elementary school - and I'll tell you, this guy is half baked and not for the reasons you think. So let me break down what you might run into and what to do about it. For the record, I bought this simply to run UWP apps - the apps from Microsoft store - and don't plan to put anything else on it because I can remote to what I need.- Won't power on: The very first thing you should do is plug this in. Don't try to power it on. While it does have a bit of a charge, it's not much. It's actually in a cold state, per Lithium battery shipping regs that don't allow fully charged batteries for risk of explosion. If you already tried, just plug it in, leave it alone for an hour, then come back and try with it still plugged in.- Can't activate Windows: I ran into this issue. This manufacturer cut corners by installing Windows 7, then doing the ""free"" upgrade to Windows 10 over top. The problem is that if you don't activate Windows 7 before doing that, Windows 10 can't be automatically activated. It's easy to fix: you have to go through manual activation. Unfortunately, this wizard is buried and not easy to find:1. go to Google and search for ""windows 10 activate via phone"" - the very top result should give you instructions. You don't need to do chat, just the phone. It's an automated prompt system. The screen you see will give you a series of numbers.2. Select the option for activating Windows 10. For all other options chose the ""other"" option which is usually 2. It should then ask you to start entering or reading this series of numbers. Do so, don't hang up yet.3. At the end, click ""Enter Confirmation ID"". The phone attendant will read you a series of numbers back. You'll type these into the boxes.4. After this it should successfully activate Windows. You can hang up now.- Can't activate Office: This happens if your Windows isn't activated. Do the previous step first, then try again. You also have to have a Windows Live account/Microsoft account, so if you don't have one, create one before trying to do this step. It's because Office is 365, which requires a Microsoft account, not the local install Office, which doesn't.- Slow performance: Mine came with drive corruption, which can affect performance. The previously mentioned upgrade shortcut was likely a culprit here, especially if they didn't power off/on correctly. Your computer may need to be rebooted a few times until it's ""happy"". Next, turn off drive indexer (in the search box type ""indexing options"" and select the app), click Modify, and remove every checkbox you see. That tells the indexer to only go against your personal files, not the entire drive, which isn't necessary for searching. Apps are always searchable.- Low drive space: this computer comes with a 32GB drive. By the time Windows finishes and updates, you'll be down to around 15GB. Buy yourself a microSD card from here or wherever; you can get a 128GB one for around $50 or a 64GB one for around $30. You can just leave that plugged into the laptop as a second drive for your files. Also, don't set up the OneDrive until/unless you get a microSD drive, because it'll eat up whatever drive space you do have left.Once you get past all that, the laptop becomes at least usable. Although that's a lot for your layman user to have to think about for something they just paid $200 on. Invest the $800-ish on a Surface Pro 4 with keyboard instead; you get what you pay for, and it'll give you a more solid experience.",3,1,5,4,3

If you need to do more intensive activities with a laptop this probably isn't the one for you, but it suits my needs great and has an excellent battery life- if I'm just browsing the internet it can last all day, though streaming video and music drains it faster, which can be said of pretty much any computer anyway.",3,1,5,4,3

1523,"I wanted to like this unit, but the experience was a negative one for me. As usual there is blame on both sides, but there were some issue that I had not been expecting, especially on the interface side of the equation. The unit itself is light and the design was really excellent. It certainly showed well. I did like the flexibility that the S-pen delivered. The screen was a little odd due to the 4x3 orientation, but I did expect that from what I read about it prior to purchasing it. It still was a bit off putting from my perspective. The operation of the unit was slower than what I expected, especially when accessing the Internet or downloading apps or files. However some real show stoppers for me were its size and the Chrome interface.I was not ready for the size of the unit and the cumbersome process for converting the unit from a PC-like device to a tablet. As a PC device it was fine, but the process of folding the unit backwards on itself was slow and cumbersome. I kept thinking that I was going to drop it on the floor during this operation. I also had some concerns of the longevity of the hinges on the unit. How long would it be before one of them broke or malfunctioned from the PC to tablet conversion? Lastly, when I had the unit in tablet configuration, it was difficult to gripping the unit. The keys on the keyboard did not help me stabilize the unit.My second big issue was the Chrome interface. Yikes, it is bad. It certainly does not seem like a step forward to me. Each time I wanted to access an app I had to go back out to the main screen, open the main app menu, then find the menu I wanted. It is a huge extra step in my opinion, especially when I was ""upgrading"" from a tablet. Many processes that I use to navigate on a tablet are lacking on this interface.",2,4,5,4,5
1524,"I compared a bunch of different laptops suitable for gaming and work. This one was the best price for the specs I was looking for. Build quality is nice. It doesn't feel cheap. It has a matte, slightly rubbery finish which feels nice. No, the screen is not an ips panel but it still looks pretty good. I have high quality monitors for my desktop and this screen doesn't bother me a bit. It can run most of the newest games on medium settings. I get 50-60 fps on BF1 and that's without any further tweaking. I thought the red accents would turn me off but it actually looks pretty nice. Not too ""loud"" or bright. The fans do get a bit noisy but not too bad to where it's annoying. Overall, I would say this is a great gaming laptop in it's price range. It boots fast and runs windows applications very quickly thanks to the ssd and i7. Almost as quick as my desktop with an i7, GTX 1080, 16gb ram, etc. You really don't need more than 8gb of ram unless you are doing some serious multi tasking.",1,0,1,2,2

I was able to do that successfully. Once I did that, I did a powerwash just in case. My machine was once again functional...for about 3 hours. Since that time, this has happened a total of 5 times. I've even contacted technical support (ACER)...they were able to help me get up and running the second time, but it still keeps happening.

I realized a few days into using it that it doesn't have a number pad like my old one, but I'm accommodating to get around that- it was mostly the minus key I'm missing so I can quickly add things like em dashes while I'm typing in Word.

1558,"Bought this PC a little less than 3 months ago after my Acer laptop of 8-9 years started deteriorating too much. Was waiting to post a review til I've used it a bit.It's been good on most fronts -- runs games pretty fast, and everything has mostly been running quickly. Some downsides are the fans get quite loud sometimes (but when wearing headphones, you won't notice it as much) and the whole PC also tends to get very hot, including the keys.After these little less than 3 months, I've now encountered a random issue of one of the keys -- the 'o' key -- not working well at all. It has to be forcefully pushed down for it to register, and sometimes doesn't work unless I've pushed it really hard several times over. I have no idea why it's been doing this; I've been very careful with the computer and have never spilled anything or got anything stuck in the keys. I'm going to have it checked out soon, but with seeing more reviews on here also noting keyboard issues and other online reviews saying the same, I'm thinking it may be a more common MSI issue, which is rather upsetting. I hope I can get it settled soon, because it's otherwise been a nice computer.Edit: Also, I noticed someone on here noted that you have to buy a license to use the webcam, but that is not true. All you need to do is remove the app that is installed for the specialty webcam that you have to pay for, and use the regular webcam that does not require you to pay anything and works like a normal webcam should.

1564,"I just bought the Surface laptop in Cobalt, I wanted the Burgundy but it was out of stock. I am a 60 year old professional who is not technologically sophisticated. I have a 17"" HP laptop at home that I love, but I desperately needed something light and easy to use. I travel quite a bit and I wanted to bring my laptop to work to take notes. My 17"" HP was too heavy. I tried out the Surface Pro and it is adorable but screen is too small. The HP two in ones were great and I actually bought one but turned out to be too heavy for regular back and forth to office so I returned it for this laptop. This laptop is just right, very light but I can work with the screen size just fine. I absolutely love the touch screen, and the material the keyboard is made from. It's really comfortable. The touchpad with cursor is very easy to use, though I still prefer a mouse. I'll get the pen soon.The Windows 10S that it comes with is annoying but the upgrade to regular Windows wasn't too difficult. The number of USB ports is small for all the things I like to attach, but no worries, I simply bought a USB attachment in Best Buy that has 4 ports in it for my mouse, printer, and flashdrives. I got a year subscription for Word, Excel, and Power Point but this suite does not come with Outlook which is separate. Best Buy transferred all my documents easily, but transferring everything I had saved in Outlook was quite difficult and time consuming, and it wasn't perfect but it is up and running now.

1571,"This is a really classy-looking computer with a lot of cool features. On the other hand, it does have some disappointing short-comings, as well.When you first start up the machine, you'll see a bunch of legal gobbledygook on the screen. This user agreement, etc., is very tedious reading on-screen, rather than on paper. It's basically saying Dell, Microsoft and their affiliates can do pretty much whatever they want, while the user is quite limited in his/her rights. There are some optional settings that Dell, Microsoft and others would like you to select that allow them to spy on you. Select ""NO"" for all the check-boxes during the set-up stage, to avoid prying eyes without limiting the performance of your machine.Even though this computer comes with Windows 10, it does not have a touch screen. It has an impressive back-lit keyboard, including a 10-key pad and shortcut/soft keys. You can adjust the back-lighting of the keyboard and the screen to adapt to personal preference during daylight use or in a darkened room. The mouse pad works fine, but I prefer to use a wireless mouse for more control. This one was particularly sensitive to touch, which I found annoying. However, serious gamers may actually prefer this sensitivity. Either way, you can adjust the settings to suit your needs.Although the screen on this computer is a few inches wider than my old laptop, the thickness of the computer is less. This means it fits more easily into a protective sleeve or case. The unit was surprisingly heavy--most likely due to the battery and other hardware. The power supply is about the size of a 3 x 5 inch card and considerably thinner than others I have seen. The cable seems thick, flexible and durable. It has a blue ring that lights up near the port when the unit is plugged in and charging. The battery seems to hold its charge for a long time, depending on what you do with the computer. Obviously, video or gaming will drain it faster than other applications.You can tell there is a really great graphics card in this machine, as the images are as crisp and clear as a high-def TV screen. The speaker system is good, too. This makes video streaming and gaming pure pleasure. The processor is quite powerful, as well. However, don't try to do anything when your computer is downloading large updates, as it can affect the performance of your machine. I did notice, when typing in word-processing and email apps, that the flow of characters on the screen could be a bit choppy. This is not a big deal, but may be distracting to some users.The software provided was pretty limited. There is a free trial of Microsoft Office 365, but it only lasts for five days. They want you to purchase or pay for licensing for their programs. However, you can find excellent free alternatives online, such as WPS Office Suite by Kingsoft or Softmaker Office. There are the usual proprietary games, browsers and other programs, including a free one-year subscription to McAfee security software.There are lots of different kinds of data ports on this computer. There are two USB 3.0 ports and one with power share. There's a headset port, an HDMI port, a media card-reader, and a network port. You can keep your computer from being stolen by using the security cable slot. I wish there was a side-by-side set of ports for both a microphone and audio, as this will only work with a headset that has a single jack; my headset has two separate jacks.Glaringly absent from this unit is a CD-Rom slot. I know CDs and DVDs are going the way of the dinosaur. However, I still have some favorite programs, movies, games and music on compact and video discs that I can't use on this device. I was able to transfer some using a cable and flash drive or network sharing. Nevertheless, I think this was a serious oversight in the design of a gaming computer. Depending on what kind of system you have, I am not sure there are enough of the right kind of ports to connect this computer to ancillary devices. You may need Bluetooth, wireless or physical adapters to hook up to other gaming equipment--such as control paddles, headsets, or your big-screen TV.If you like to ""see"" your opponent when gaming, or enjoy Skyping friends and family, there is a camera built into this computer. I am inclined, however, to keep the lens covered with a sticky note when not in use. Call me paranoid, but the idea of someone being able to access and turn this on remotely to spy on me really creeps me out! There is a dual microphone with the camera, which I assume allows for communication in stereo.Some users complained of exceptionally loud fans on this computer. Either I don't use enough resources to require them to run so heavily, or mine were in better shape than those people, because I did not notice anything out-of-the-ordinary.I appreciate how easily this computer starts up and shuts down. Most of the other machines I am used to take their own sweet time--which means you have to allow yourself a few minutes before sitting down to work/play when you start up the machine or before you walk away when you are done.",1,0,3,2,2
1572,I absolutely love my plus. I honestly can't think of a negative comment about it. Its excatly what I expected. I did hear about some problems with the touch screen but mine works perfectly. The speakers have some decent sound behind them for being bottom firing. I bought the Samsaung over the Asus solely because of this screen and wow it is pretty impressive. Bright and all the colors pop beautifully. The whites and very bright and the blacks are deep and dark. The battery charges in about 2ish hours (or at least thats when I noticed it was fully charged) and lasted on a full charge for about 5 days with basic usage like youtube videos and emails.

After updating and setting everything up I kept getting an error message ""application blocked from accessing graphics hardware"" whenever I would try to watch a video, which then would crash the computer. I searched online to try to find a fix including uninstalling/reinstalling drivers and more to no avail. The Amazon product assistance said it was probably a hardware issue and issued a refund.",1,4,3,2,3

1592,"This could have been a great laptop, except for one irritating and one fatal flaw. The irritation was the significant light bleed in several corners and along two sides of the screen. I know the difference between ""normal"" IPS glow, and light bleed due to poor manufacturing and quality control. This was the latter. The panel is simply bonded too tightly with the chassis, and slightly warped in a few places, so that the LCD screen is compressed and lets through too much light from the LED's behind it.The second, and really inexcusable flaw, was a loose touchpad that made a clicking/rattling noise with every touch, swipe, or any other contact between my fingers and the pad. Not just button presses, but any touch made this noise. It was incredibly distracting. How Acer lets products in this condition make it out of the factory is beyond me. Do they really expect people to keep something like this? So this laptop got returned, and it's time to try a different brand.",2,0,3,2,2

This machine is absolutely able to do anything I wanted to do with my old laptop or my Surface (both of which I'll be getting rid of now). Rather than run through all the same praises as the other reviews on here (sturdy build, good key response, great battery, etc) I'll just say this was the most painless out-of-box introduction to any machine I've ever used. 5 minutes to sign into my accounts and whatnot, and I was running Spotify, Robinhood, and had multiple tabs open on Chrome, all with no problem. (Though one minor downside that I've read about I can confirm: the speakers are not gonna blow you away. Not bad enough to detract from a 5 -star rating, though.) If you're on the fence, like I was for many months, just go for it.",2,4,5,4,5

1604,"So I have bought a lot of laptops both cheap and super expensive. I thought Samsung had good quality and good hardware, but after using this I would tell everyone to stay away. All in all the chromebook was SUER slow. I was expecting super fast speed online and I barely got that. I think my Samsung phone might be faster. The other thing too, is that the Pen falls out and can be lost easily, and it is kinda useless in my opinion. No apps or things online really need a pen, so its a wasted feature. Give me a better screen or more sensitive mousepad than a pen that doesnt do anything and falls out. The other thing is that the battery life is really bad. I dont really use my chromebook for much but the battery was dead in about 3 hours from web browsing and playing music. My 5 year old laptop has about the same battery life. Maybe it is worth the wait for the pro model but this model is no good. I do not suggest anyone buy it.",2,4,5,4,5

This device has a KNOWN issue with the touch screen where after some time, it will no longer respond to touch except for via the supplied pen. I.e., the touch screen no longer responds to your finger. I went through the extremely painful process to obtain an RMA number from tech support and ship the device to a repair center, only to be contacted by the repair company claiming there was ""physical damage"" to the device (no way - it was absolutely mint, and I packaged it EXTREMELY well using layers of bubble wrap and an oversized box with a lot of packing material inside). They were trying to extort approximately $250 from me to repair it. All because of a KNOWN problem with the touch screen. I am beyond unsatisfied. Cutting my losses and buying another brand of Chromebook, preferably from a company who stands behind their product.",2,4,5,4,5

Yes you could use the cloud-based versions of Office with the monthly subscription fees. But this was a gift for a high school kid, with no means to pay subscriptions. We needed to load Office 2010 (3 Gb) on the hard drive (SSD). It has an SD card slot, but Office doesn't run off an external SD card. With no Gb left on the SSD, it's almost useless as a laptop.

1618,"Honestly,It's totally a steal - to get all these features for such a price. If not for the issues I have faced - which I think is only with the laptop that I've received and not to every laptop, I would totally recommend it.Not sure if 3 stars would be a correct rating to this product. I haven't used it much, and I personally might have got a damaged product but - these are the couple of issues I have faced with this Laptop and Dell.1. Whenever I play a video online or offline, I get a crackling sound, not continuous though. Usually, it lasts for like 2-3 seconds and then audio will be clear again.2. It's not even two weeks and I see some vertical lines as if the display is already damaged. But I'm sure that this product hasn't had any damage after reaching me. All the time it was the only desk and there no way it could get damaged staying on my study desk. These lines are vertical and are only on left half of the screen. These are also not persistent. They just appear for like 1 second and disappear. More often than this I see horizonatal lines appearing for a split of a second.3. I haven't really explored this laptop a lot, but I couldn't even play FIFA 17 on this without any disturbances, I just pauses for a while and then I had to minimize it and then open it again to play. Although the name suggest its a GAMING Edition.I'm quite disappointed to see all these issues come up in like 2 weeks of time. But I am glad that this happened in like the first month itself, so now I can return this thing without losing any money.And with the Dell Customer care, I hoped that they would help me get through this. I was on the call with them for HOURS, they tried installing some drivers and all was in fail. It didn't and I also have to attend another call from them, hopefully, it doesn't take hours again. I am gonna attend that other call scheduled on Monday and decide on returning this laptop to Amazon.",1,0,1,2,2

This doesn't act like a refurbished item at all and is very fast. I like that it turns on automatically when I open it. The packaging was plain but very secure and my laptop came without a scatch! I saw some others say they hadn't gotten a charging cable but I think they just missed it. You have to dig all the way to the bottom of the box, where there is smaller piece of cardboard separating the charging cable from the rest of the packaging.

1630,"Had to return this. I love Dell computers so I was very sad when I had to return this product. When it arrived I was a little disappointed in how inexpensive it felt. The texture feels very plasticy. I had problems right from the beginning. The sound worked sometimes, but not other times. The computer would freeze when loading websites and it would freeze when I would type on Word - not something that takes a lot of memory, so I have no idea why it was so glitchy. I contacted Dell and there was a very nice tech who helped me. I let him take control of the computer and he ran all of the diagnostics and couldn't get it working correctly either. He said he was going to do an exchange for me. I told him it was important that I have a working computer quickly for a project I was working on. He said he understood. For two weeks I checked the status of my request and it said open. Then one day I checked it and it said ""closed"" and when I checked the computer part of it it said computer ""unavailable"". I checked with Amazon and they allowed me to return the computer right away, thankfully. I went to restore the system back to factory settings before sending the computer back to Amazon and it asked me if I wanted to restore back to Windows 7. Then I was really frustrated because I purposely bought a Windows 10 O.S. This meant that they sent me a computer with a Windows 10 O.S. built on top of a Windows 7 O.S. I could have purchased a nicer computer for a lot less with a Windows 7 O.S. and installed the Windows 10 platform on top myself if that is what I had wanted!!!Anyway, this was just a big disappointed for me all the way around.",2,2,1,3,2

Speaking of the battery, I use it on the work and I can even leave the charge in my house and it can still last from 9am to 6am without any problem.However, I have two small complaints:1) The palmrest is kinda loose and create some noise when press it.

It is almost the same as using headphone when I listen to my favorite music, but you have to be right in front at the computer.Overall, the performance is good; the CPU is the lastest and fast.The keyboard is quite good and comfortable.I don't really like the red line design but I rather it is plain steel.The battery can let you use about 4.5 hours if you just internet and youtube.The wifi works perfectly like the advertising. It works well even though I am a little far away from the router and have a wall in between.The fan is not noisy, and the thermal control is very good.

1646,"I have been using this laptop for about 6 months, and I am basically happy with it. The one problem I have had is with the CD/DVD drive: it is extremely finicky to open. I have to do this slightly frustrating thing where I push the drive further into the computer and then push the open/close toggle with one of my fingers; sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. (Just pushing on the toggle button without pushing in the drive doesn't work at all.) Fortunately, I don't have to use the CD/DVD drive very often. I don't do gaming on this computer; just basic business application stuff. However, I do have a lot of applications open at once, and the amount of RAM seems sufficient for this: the speed/performance is fine. I am pleased that the touchpad includes separate buttons for left and right click (a previous version of HP computer tried to combine this into the touchpad and it was extremely frustrating and difficult to use). Overall, it seems like it was a reasonably good computer with a lot of RAM and large hard drive (1.8TB) at a reasonable price ($550).",3,2,0,1,2
1647,It's a good quality Chromebook for the price and i haven't had any problems with it.,2,2,5,4,3
1648,"So far I have had this laptop for a few days and I have to say that for the price, this is a great buy if you wanna start getting into PC gaming. It looks good, feels good, runs most games that I've thrown at it at great frame rates. PUBG and Fortnite play very smooth. Skyrim plays with no issues, I haven't tried any larger more intensive games but I'm guessing you can get some pretty good frame rates at medium to high-ish settings. I like the specs a lot, but I do plan on upgrading the ram to 16Gb and the 1Tb HDD to a faster SDD. The screen looks really nice, gets fairly bright and good viewing angles. The speakers sound pretty good, a bit better than average. The only downsides I've noticed is battery life and noise. When your playing any games its ""CoolBoost"" technology kicks in and its quite loud. BUT it does keep this laptop really cool on a desk. It could be a different story when its sitting on a bed. The battery life does really suck since its a gaming computer but it doesn't really bother me. One problem is the strength of the lower screen. When you push inward or outward on the bottom middle of the trim around the screen it flexes really bad. So much so that I fear I could accidentally break it when carrying this thing around the house with it open.Other than that I highly recommend this to someone who cant spend the extra 400 for a gaming laptop. At 750, this is a pretty good deal.Fix the screen flex problem though Acer, haha.",2,0,1,0,2

Its 1080p, but its got to be a TN panel bc the viewing angles are bad unless youre looking right at it and the colors just arent that great (though turning up the saturation in the graphics panel helped push some color in-Its cheap. windows alone costs what? Around 100 bucks. I got this for 220-It boasts a 9hr battery life. Im getting probably more like 4-5. Though I do have the brightness turned upThe main reason Im giving this a 5 star rating is because I just needed a computer to run Examplify to take exams on and this was cheap and doesnt completely suck as a computer as a whole. It exceeded my expectations. It will not replace my Dell Chromebook 13 as my daily driver though because that laptop is better in every way (except it doesnt run windows to run Examplify).Ill probably give this compter to someone once Im out of school for browsing the internet assuming the battery doesnt die",3,4,5,4,3

BTW, the screen looks fine, after reading the reviews about people swapping out the monitor, I was expecting garbage. It really look good, and I edit photos for a living. It's not pro, and you do have to tilt it to the right angle, but it's nothing to worry about. Certainly would not even consider swapping it out. BTW, it does look awesome connected to my 32"" Samsung. Fallout 4 on the 32' looked great with this laptop. One tip, when you connect a second monitor via HTML, you will have to reselect the sound source, it defaulted to the HTML, even if it had no speakers.Also, after I did all the software updates, I was surprised to see the video source defaulted to the Intel onboard graphics, which will slow the system down. I had to go into the Nvidia settings and select the Nvidia graphics as the default for global settings. I thought that strange and might not have noticed if I hadn't run a benchmark and was surprised at how slow the graphics were until I changed the default.The BIOS settings are really dumbed down, not much to do there.The build is good, seems sturdy. It is not a light weight computer, but as a desktop replacement, I did not think it would be. Keyboard is good, and looks sharp with the red backlighting.Overall, very pleased, so far. I almost marked it down for having to fiddle with the Sound and video settings, and the consumerish BIOS, but it doesn't really detract from what seems to be a fine computer for the price.

1668,"One thing you should be aware of which is a general problem with Dell laptops: it is possible that after you've had it for a while, the laptop will stop registering that the power supply is connected. It will show a ""plugged in, not charging"" sign instead of ""plugged in, charging."" The main issue with this (other than the fact that the battery will not charge) is that it causes the laptop to respond by slowing everything down to the point where it's nearly unusable and definitely frustrating. (Think an in interval of several minutes between when you click something and when the action happens). When this happened to me I read all about it online in hopes of finding a solution, but apparently the solution is with the mechanical prongs that sit within the structure of the jack. What I took home from everything I read is that if this problem happens, then it pretty much means that it's time to stop using the laptop and to get a new one. Granted, for me it happened after a few years, so if you think you'll be okay with buying a new laptop after 3-4 years then this may not be an issue for you-- but I do think that this is something you should take into consideration ahead of time. I should note that the Dell laptop I had was not a $600 one, it was much pricier than that, so it wasn't a consequence of it being cheap; you might be lucky and never run into this problem, but I think you ought to be aware that this is a general problem for Dell laptops (you can look this up online and read more about it).",2,2,0,2,2

1693,"I'm travelling a lot for work, so as a gamer of course my first priority was to buy myself a gaming laptop. After a couple of months of research, I realized that every laptop out there is always missing one key component whether it's the video card, SSD, display, cooling, etc. I finally picked this one because it seemed to have most of what I was looking for: A decent SSD, a 1070 video card (can't afford any higher), and good cooling (based on reviews).After a few months of using it, I'm very pleased with its performance. The Geforce 1070 is good enough to play every game I've thrown at it at 2k resolution w/DSR and G-Sync on. Some of the games I've played so far at almost max settings are Witcher 3, PUBG, Divinity:OS 2, Just Cause 3, and Rainbow Six:Siege. I haven't had any overheating issues, which is one of the biggest concerns for many gaming laptops.The 2 cons I've noticed are, as some other reviewers have mentioned:1. On 4 or 5 occasions, the laptop has gone into some sort of sleep mode and I couldn't bring it back up. I could hear the fans spinning at max capacity, but it requires me to turn the laptop off and on again. I've read similar issues like this one on their forums from other people.2. There is some backlight bleeding going on. On my laptop, it's on the right side of the screen. Only noticeable when displaying very dark or pitch black screens.Also, I'm not counting this as a con because it's just how it's built, but the laptop + power adapter is quite heavy. I bought the following backpack to carry it around:Everki Beacon Laptop Backpack with Gaming Console Sleeve, Fits up to 18-Inch (EKP117NBKCT) - So far, so good!I would recommend this laptop to those looking for something similar to the specs it carries.UPDATE: The Q/A section is filled with confusion regarding this model's monitor refresh rate.

1710,"This is probably the best laptop you can purchase in the $500 range; with a few caveats:- The 1TB Hard drive is 5400 RPM, on the slower end of HDDs which means that programs booting up are going to be a bit slower. You can easily upgrade to a 7200 RPM HDD (which would be the baseline/standard) or if your willing to pay for a Solid State Drive obviously that would dramatically boost boot time. I purchased a Seagate 500gb 7200RPM for $40, ghost the OS and files and now use the 1TB as an external drive-Comes with 8gb of RAM but an additional slot is easily accessible on the underside. I immediately popped it open and dropped in a Crucial 8GB DDR4 2400 ($60). 16gb of RAM is plenty and can handle anything your planning on running on this machine. (If your looking to drop more than 16gb you should probably be shopping for a beefier machine overall (i7 processor, GTX 1070, etc)- Intel HD 620 integrated graphics; this model laptop cannot be upgraded with a more robust graphics card however the 620 isn't terrible. Arguably on par with the Nvidia GTX 400/500 series from several years ago, so nothing incredible but certainly usable for older games or non graphics intensive programs. Check out on you tube some benchmark test to see if its acceptable to you.- very little bloatware: seems trivial, but seriously, it can be exhausting researching pre-installed software and going through the uninstall process. I was immensely pleased that this machine had practically none on it.- In summary: a well balanced laptop with room for some easy improvements (you'll easily put between $100 - $150 in upgrades into it, but if search for a laptop that has the features I described already installed your easily look at a $300 increase in price.) If you are someone looking to purchase a new gaming laptop or something for editing picture/ video, you should probably look elsewhere.

Well yes ,not serious ones .Too few USB's only 2 ,I always had 3 and miss the extra one.The keys are ok ,only ok ,not excited about them.Also I thought the keyboard was backlit,well ttheyr'e not..Despite those negatives ,I think I will really love this computer .I think you will too.I'm glad I waited for the 8th generation ,it's great.1/14/2018 :After using this for a couple of weeks ,I have simmered down a bit.First I wish the screen was a little sharper and being a small screen it gets a little hard to read the lettering.I also notice that the sound while ok ,is not too great.I'm comparing this Zen to a Lenovo ideapad which is 6 or 7 years old,much sharper, better sound ,but almost twice as heavy.I notice it is (kinda) backlit ,again not as well backlit as the Lenovo .I will say the Lenovo cost $200 more than the Zen.What I appreciate most is the 7 second boot time and the long battery life.2/2/2018An update.I got a scare a week ago.I got a black screen ,it wouldn't boot.I kept trying turning of and on for an hour.Eventually it started to work again.I did a restore point.The only problem with buying a computer online is ,it's not easy to return.Prices are better on Amazon but unlike Best Buy you can't drive and return it.Food for thought.",3,3,3,2,4

This is the Chromebook perfection I have been waiting for with android installed natively. I'm looking forward to where these chromebook/tablets are going to go. Right now, nothing does this better on this platform. I'm looking forward to a slightly better camera. It serves its purpose but if you want to do hd conference calls or webcasts you will still need to get a decent clip on camera. The wide angle of this camera is unappealing, this is matched with poor ISO performance and a really contrasty image. Other than that, this is a pretty slick device and is great for showing off work to your clients and stakeholders.",2,4,5,4,5
1753,"I was not considering ASUS or buying a laptop through the internet, but the specs on this ASUS hit all the right marks for me. I was after a solid work-focused laptop and I wanted to save as much money as possible by giving up on the frills while keeping the important stuff (I don't care about a touch screen, I don't need a fancy designated graphics card for my purposes, I really don't care about how stylish it looks, how light it is, or how thin it is, etc.). I was deciding between a thinkpad and a latitude, apologizing to my wallet, when I saw this laptop promoted by amazon and bought it the next day.I upgraded the HHD to a Samsung SSD (this one:Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E250B/AM)) almost immediately (it was indeed very easy) and am satisfied with this computer in every single way but for one: the screen is terrible. I don't just mean that the screen is not stunning as an apple or xps, I knew that this was a regular anti-glare display going in and I was all for that, I mean that the screen actually causes me tremendous eye strain when working on it for over half an hour (excel, access, word, visual studio). The best I can describe it is that it does not have enough depth or contrast-- everything looks washed out with white-blue light. The fault is not the intel integrated graphics -- those are great. It looks beautiful plugged into any other displays -- its just the screen itself. It seems like a very strange place to save money to me. If it were something that could be upgraded easily I wouldn't take off stars, but replacing the screen on a laptop, especially when you are trying to upgrade and not just replace the stock screen, is tedious work to me. I found a company that will let you send it in to them to upgrade for about $120 and I might give this a try down the road, but that with the SSD upgrade ruin the value I got by going with this laptop over a latitude or thinkpad. For the time being I just use external displays to do any real work on it -- kind of destroying the point of a laptop a little bit.",2,2,1,2,2
1754,"This is one sleek laptop. It has some good specs for a gaming laptop at a price more affordable than most in its category.The laptop boots up quickly and the design and build are top quality. I love the backlit keyboard and this gets decent battery life even when gaming.The one thing that really stands out to me though is just how loud it is. Unless I wear a headset, the fan can get very distracting. I will note that I rarely have music or TV on when I am on my laptop so if you tend to have Spotify or Pandora playing in the background you may not notice it as much.But I love the power and looks of it and it is a good value for a gaming laptop.",1,0,1,2,2
1755,"Bought the laptop, and despite being brand new I shelved it for one year due to being incredibly slow compared to its brother, Asus' Chromebook C201, a nearly identical computer but with a different, ARM-based CPU. Every time I opened this computer, it took 25 minutes for Windows Update to do its thing before I just gave up, turned it off, and used the Chromebook. Seems like no matter how often I would use it, once a month, once a week, once every few days, it would do the exact same thing.Over the course of a year, I have accumulated maybe 6 hours of use out of it, to make an extremely optimistic estimate. Checked tonight with WinDirStat and Windows is using over 75% of the hard drive space, and wants more than there is space remaining to do its most recent update - thus it cannot update. I only ever installed two (2!) programs on this computer - Google Chrome, and a utility used for tuning vehicle control modules (HPTuner) which is why I needed a Windows laptop in the first place.I have not stored any media nor any files on this computer beyond 1MB worth of control module configurations.This is not a Windows computer. It is a brick. It is a shelf ornament. It is ridiculous. The hardware's probably good, maybe, but I never got a chance to use it. Maybe I'll figure that part out when we install Linux, which seems to be the only way to turn this into a usable computer.Chromebook is fine though, thousands of hours of use and never had to worry about hard drive space.",3,1,5,4,3

1775,"This laptop has honestly been great. I got a good deal on it by buying it through Amazon Warehouse, but I think it would even be worth its full price.First off, I love the stylus. I do digital art so it's a great asset. I have a Wacom tablet as well, so I have a bunch of different s-Pens with different nib textures that work with this. There is something great about being able to draw right on the screen.The laptop is very snappy and the battery lasts forever. I love that it charges with USB-C. I do sometimes miss the USB-A port with things like my wired mouse or flash drive. This isn't a big deal, but you may need to get new Bluetooth mice, etc.Aesthetically, the aspect ratio is interesting. Sometimes it takes me a second to get accustomed to it after using other devices. It definitely has more usable space for websites, though. I also wish it was available in black like the Pro. I didn't need a more powerful machine so I just went with the Plus, even though I prefer the black color.I didn't think that I would care about not having a backlit keyboard, but honestly it's kind of annoying. I like to watch my laptop to fall asleep which means the screen is too dim to illuminate the keyboard. I just use it in tent or media mode, but then it's more difficult to adjust the screen brightness.Speakers are pretty underwhelming. I find that I need to the volume to be turned all the way up to hear anything.The keyboard is a little cramped. I have small hands so it doesn't bother me, but when I switch between normal full size keyboards and this one, my first few minutes of typing will have more errors and mistypes.The small backspace button doesn't bother me too much though.But all in all this is a great portable laptop. It does everything I need it to do. It definitely won't replace full function, high powered desktops and laptops. I have a gaming desktop and an old Macbook Pro to do the things that Chromebooks can't do.",2,4,5,4,5

But it has been a total loss of money.From the beginning it was super slow, the technical support of Dell tried to help me by phone, but they did nothing. A month and a half ago it completely went out and it did not turn on anymore. Apparently all at a certain point reflect this failure. The technical support made me send it to Texas to the repair center, and there it lasted almost a month. Then It arrived last week and two days later it went off again and did not turn on, AGAIN!. I just called to make the return, because I do not want this computer anymore, how is it possible that after two days of coming ""Repaired"" will be damaged again ?.

1782,"I believe this device is meant to compete with Chromebook. That's the market. It has more internal storage than some big-selling Chromebooks. Some will criticize this device on the basis of its internal storage capability. Not me, that part is fine. It's slow though. I think it's fair to criticize this device for its relative slowness.This is a serious device to consider if one is already thinking about a Chromebook. One has to weigh many different points to know which will be best for one's purposes.Here are some points I believe are worthy of consideration:1. Got an extra Microsoft Office license to spare? That's one important issue for many. If so, that makes this device more attractive.2. Is your router close to where you'll operate this device? My Apple computers and Kindles work further from the router than this one. I consider that a potential limitation that I think one should keep in mind.3. It's got Windows 10. I think it's designed to be a universal app ecosystem. The start menu really presents the many programs nicely. Keep in mind that many or most of these programs aren't included except for separate purchases. The default browser is Microsoft Edge.4. It's got 32 GB internal storage. My Chromebook has half that and it's surprising how much one can do without relying on internal storage.5. The ports can't be beat for this market with USB 3.0, HDMI - still has two USB 2 ports.6. My experience is this is very good for typing. The keyboard is big and it certainly beats my Chromebook by a lot. I like the way my hands fit on it and that my wrists rest nicely on it. The keys on the keyboard are ok.7. I see that hourglass too much. All the little wait times add up. I ask myself whether the typing comfort offsets the waiting, and I just don't know.8. The screen is workmanlike. I consider it basic when compared to alternatives, but it's not bad. If one is doing some continuing professional education on this device, for example, the screen is just fine.",3,4,5,4,3
1783,"PROS:+ I'm in love with the chassis texture which is nice to touch and hides oil stains to a degree (see Cons)+ Comfortable humanized keyboard, plus full numpad, makes touch typing a breeze+ Speedy SSD with cold boot times of less than 10s (see Neutrals)+ Screen boasts a number of comfortable viewing angles (see Neutrals)+ Removable battery with decent life--a single full charge will yield close to 7 hours for normal computing tasks and up to 5 for watching videos/movies+ Fan is whisper quiet when it kicks onNEUTRALS:* Skimpy storage at only 128GB (250GB would've been much better without pushing the cost much higher), but I guess there's still plenty of room if you're a cloud-happy consumer* Half-size left/right arrow keys--which is a bummer for me since I often use keyboard shortcuts which include those arrow keys and sometimes find myself hitting empty space* Ultra-low profile keys with minimal travel, though it does still have that satisfying click as you type, which require acclimation if you're coming from higher profile keys or mechanical keyboard* No backlighting on the keyboard--I know it doesnt say anywhere that it has this feature, but it doesnt say that it doesnt either...Im just making it extra clear for the curious* While the screen has several nice viewing angles, the colours can get a bit washed out and, depending on what you're doing, images aren't crisp (not the point that it renders this laptop unusable, but it may be problematic if you do a lot of photo/video editing/viewing)* This thing takes its time to recharge requiring upwards of 3-4 hours for a full recharge from 10%* Speakers are what you'd expect from a laptop and get even muddier when you kick up the volume--that said, this is a Neutral rather than Con as this seems to be an area most laptops fail miserably inCONS:- Trackpad and keys are a little too eager to absorb the oils from your fingers/hands, and while it's less visible on the textured chassis, it's still there and slightly more difficult to clean up- Speaking of the trackpad, straight out of the box it was incredibly sluggish and imprecise (i.e. you could be sliding your finger across it, but the mouse stubbornly refuses to move)--I dug around and found the Dell trackpad settings which helped somewhat, though not much- If you hope to install a bit more memory (which youll want to do if youre a heavy multi-tasker), or even swap out the SSD for a larger/faster one, youll discover firsthand how needlessly painful it is to remove the rear panel- This is one hefty beast, not bad if you're keeping it on a desk, but could be annoying if you must lug it around daily- The never-ending bloatware is brutal, mostly due to Microsoft, especially if you set up multiple accounts (it's like zombie software just pops up out of nowhere despite having uninstalled it from the Admin account)NOTES:This is not a gaming machine and never will be no matter how much memory or storage you throw at it. But for the price this isnt a bad starter machine. You dont need to add anything in order to have a spry little workhorse. It may, however, be lightweight for a business machine (unless your business doesnt go beyond emailing, writing a few memos, and basic blogging).Im almost tempted to compare this with myAcer E5-575-33BM, but wont because these laptops are in slightly different leagues. This one is much more lightweight feature-wise though similarly speced. Not to mention, its faster than the stock Acer.This is a great choice if you have a kid still in school or heading off to college (or if youre heading off to college yourself) and you want a no fuss no muss laptop that will get the job done. That said, if you dont mind investing another hundred dollars to have a mini powerhouse, then Id recommend getting the Acer plus memory and SSD upgrades.

On three occasions while watching full screen videos I had the sound, its very loud and makes you think its about to explode. I really wanted to keep the device but the shiny exterior became easily scratched, the android apps crashed often and the speaker crackle all added up to a fail for me.

This uses a 7th generation I7 processor (I-7 7500U), which rates around the 50th percentile in terms of all CPUs. Quite fast for everyday use, although it rates in the bottom third of the many flavors of Core I-7 processors. But I have some spreadsheets that use computation-intensive simulations that can really benefit from a speedy CPU. I didn't know that an 8th gen Core I-5 processor like the 8250U is actually much faster for heavy computing (I figured any I-7 CPU has to be faster than any I-5 CPU...silly me). And you can get an I-5 8250U processor for only $599 in the Acer Aspire E15 model on this site.

1811,"Chromebook has been a pleasure to use (2 weeks) especially the amazing screen quality!The build materials are great, (metal all around) it feels more sturdy than my ipad which seems fragile by comparison.The Chromebook uses Android Apps out of the box, and mostly my experience has been very good. A fee apps (whatsapp for example) says not compatible with this device. I think once all of the glitches are ironed out by Google and a universal app (phone and tablet) version is the norm the Chromebook will easily replace Windows laptops.The Chrome OS although simple, is really really fast! I haven't had any software problems with the Chrome side. At first, I thought the Chromebook wouldn't be too useful but the more I use it, the less I am carrying around my laptop (as others have also stated on Amazon.)Battery life has been very good, and since this is my first tent/convertible device I have to say its a great feature to use. Viewing movies, presentations and Skype are really great in tent mode.One additional area to comment on - the sound quality. Playing music or videos on the Chromebook Plus has awesome sound from the speakers. Im not sure why others are complaining because honestly its one of the devices best features imo.Areas for improvement - Obviously make all Android apps compatible. That must happen and soon.Second is somehow integrate the Chromebook with an Android phone. That would solve the compatibility problem - run the app on the phone just display it on the Chromebook!I think the price is somewhat high, but after using the amazing 4K Amoled TouchScreen for a while - the price will seem reasonable.The entire experience really is modern, light, and surprisingly good.

1814,"This laptop is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I needed something that was light, sturdy, portable, fast, and good on battery life.Build:This laptop is sturdy with hardly any flex to be found. The exterior of the laptop is metal and looks quite nice. The inside is a premium grade plastic. The laptop is extremely solid when closes and I have no worries throwing it into my backpack. It is extremely light and hardly noticeable on my back. The keyboard is surprisingly nice to use (I had expected it to be bad, but boy was I wrong).Screen: The 13 inch ultrabook screen size is perfect. I used to have a 17 inch display but I do not miss it after having the portability of the 13. I do not have any trouble reading the display. The display gets plenty bright for me in nearly every condition. It is sharp and just all around good looking.Battery: This batter lasts far longer than I ever expected it to. Even on the highest performance settings, I can expect it to last about 4 hours. By turning down the brightness of the keyboard and screen, I can get easily over 9 hours of continuous use of of this thing.Speed: Make sure to get the Intel 8th gen chip. Do not settle for the 7th gen or anything less. The 8th is at least a 40% improvement over the 7 and it shows. This thing is lightning fast. It holds many chrome tabs and programs with ease. I have absolutely no problems with the speed of this device (and I am very picky).Price: Anything cheaper than this will have a significant drop in reliability and build quality. You can get other laptops for cheaper, but I wouldn't. After examining many of its competitors (Dell XPS 13, HP Envy, etc.), I can truly say that this is the best value. Other well known ultrabooks do a fantastic job and may improve slightly over this device, but it will come at a much greater cost.Gaming: Extremely light gaming is doable on this laptop but that is definitely not it's intended purpose. If you expect this to be your main computer as a gamer, you should look elsewhere. Ultrabooks just aren't made for that. You will still need to invest in something with a dedicated graphics card and an i7. I use this laptop when I am away from my gaming desktop.",3,3,3,2,4

1822,I wanted a gaming computer that did not break the bank. I am pleased with the computers performance so far. I have had it a couple of months now and my games perform much better on it vs my old laptop. A big reason I went with this over other comparable models was this one offered a lit keyboard in red. I know some people do not like that it's red but red doesn't mess with your eyes as much at night so I was happy they made it that color. Its bright enough to see the keys but not obnoxious or overly stimulating.,1,0,1,2,2

The screen is beautiful.The best laptop today.delivery and amazon service is a little bit not up to the mark . other than amazon services definitely recommended",2,4,5,4,5
1826,"This laptop is great for the price. Even though it's a Celeron CPU the performance is pretty good because it's a newer generation one. I was also surprised to see that it is quad core. It's at a 6W(Watt) TDP(thermal design power) so the laptop doesn't get too hot.I really like that it's fanless because you can actually put it on your lap without getting third degree burns. I chose this over others because I will never go below 1080p resolution. The screen is a TN panel so it can look washed at the wrong angles but for the price I don't care. I saw some reviews complaining about the touchpad which I don't understand because in my opinion it is really good, especially for this price because I have seen shitty ones on laptops in the 400 dollar range. Obviously we will talk about the elephant in the room which is the 32GB storage which is also non-replaceable along with the RAM. A tip I can give is just either uninstall some junk or fresh install Windows like I did. First thing to do is install all the updates to know how much space you have to work with. Some simple solutions are external drives or flash drives if you need more space. There is one good thing about the storage however, it is an eMMC which is similar to a solid state drive and basically like the storage you use in your phone so it's fast and not a mechanical hard drive. If you are going to buy this laptop you are looking to do basic things with it like watching videos (most of which are 1080p these days which is why i will never go below 1080p). I personally am using it for programming and school work, as well as booting Linux from an external drive. F2 to enter the BIOS by the way.You should not buy this for gaming, video editing, etc. It's thin, light, 1080p, doesn't get hot and makes no noise, all I really need as a temporary solution.",3,4,5,4,3

Getting acclimated to ChromeOS is challenging. Not AMOLED, just like TVs ALL Backlight LEDs display bland shadows on dark screened movies/videos (although is still a beautiful display otherwise...)This is perfect for my intended uses. I have a Windows10 on another MSI Laptop that is older but, still more than sufficient for all of my Microsoft needs for business and work programs/apps. I am replacing my Galaxy Tab S 8.4 and HP laptop from 2012.After acclimating to this OS I am enjoying this device a lot more. There is a learning curve depending what you are used to.

This morning, it took about 5 minutes to open an excel doc. The fan always runs like crazy and the fan is loud, I can't figure out what is going on in the background. I buy a lot of items from Amazon and I have never written a review, basically because I've always been satisfied, but not this time. I will never buy a PC/Laptop from Amazon again after this experience. I will buy it from somewhere I know exactly what I am getting, I can try it out and have it supported.",3,2,0,1,2
1858,"The smallish size and light weight means this thing is super portable. I instinctively held it up to my ear to listen for the sound of a mechanical hard drive/fan, but this has neither. Thanks to the SSD and passively cooled processor, it is completely quiet. The monitor is a decent 720p with good color. Handles web browsing well, and plays back video on Hulu and Netflix smoothly at 720p. Keep in mind this is the least expensive 'laptop' you can get with full Windows 10 on it. There are a lot of things the little Celeron chip will NOT do, such as intense 3D gaming. It does not handle 1080p video well, you will start to see slowdowns at this threshold. If you're wanting something that does these things you will need to spend more than $170. If you already have a more powerful machine in the house, or if you are not into gaming, this is an adequate solution. If you are unsure it will meet your needs you may want to check it out in person first.",3,4,5,4,3

A few degrees make quite a bit of difference on this laptop.The application response is a bit slow if you're used to using gen6 core-i3 processors or better, but still OK when you consider what you paid for this device.Geekbench indicates 988-single and 2536-multiple CPU test and approx 5500 OpenCL GPU test.This is quite good for an Intel Atom x5-Z8350 and Intel HD Graphics 400 GPU.4GB of memory ticks along at ~2GB used, with enough threshold for a few tasks to be open at the same time and responsive.Not uncommon to see 1.9GHz CPU speed with power level-5 on heavy processing.All up a good light laptop with enough response for the average Internet consumer.For the average punter a 64GB eMMC builtin SSD would have rounded out the package as 32GB SSD will be a bit of a challenge for those that don't feel comfortable running cleanups on the Winsxs folder and/or managing the placement/location of user data and programs.Update - OK curiosity got the better of me and I had a peak under the covers. (see photo)My limited knowledge of battery informational details indicates to me that the battery was made in 2014, which may explain why in 2017 I have lost 10.6% of the battery on the day I purchased the ASUS E200HA(AUG-2017), my Chinese/Japanese readings skills are nil, so I could be wrong.The build date for the laptop is indicated as MAY-2017 and also confirmed with Windows 10 OS burn date.Also noted, there is no chance to upgrade to a 2x2 WiFi card as there is only one antenna cable provided.

I use it to log into my online classes, grade student work (longer essays, discussion boards, etc.), browse the internet, and watch dreary BBC detective shows in bed at night. I am not a ""high maintenance"" tech -gadget person. If it gets the job done, I'm happy. While it's small, and I probably will never try to write a novel on it, it's fine for what I bought it for.

1873,"I bought one of these because I normally love Google/Samsung and love my Android phone. Im not a fan of Apple so I don't think their products are better than the Chromebook - I hate Apple products probably equally as much as I hated my Chromebook which I returned after discovering its useless for my purposes. I realized that it's basically like a large mobile phone, and you can't access certain websites, at least not the desktop version of websites, and this was an absolute deal breaker for me. Even if there is an app available, its usually very limited. I wanted to install the Brave browser and all I could get for it was an app which was extremely limited and wouldn't let me use the extensions I want. Instead it's better to buy a Rasberry Pi and run Rasberrian on it because they have about the same amount of power. In fact the Pi is better in many ways. For example, the Pi is only 1/10 the price, takes up less space, is more energy efficient, can access desktop versions of websites, run desktop apps, has an ethernet port and with this useless Chromebook I had to waste money on a multi-port hub adapter for $120 which I will probably donate to charity. Don't make the same mistake as me thinking you can install Linux onto it or boot from it off a thumb drive. Its not that easy and wasnt worth the struggle of trying IMO. The people saying its easy are talking about doing it on the regular Chromebook with the Intel chip. Although they're fast, I feel Intel chips are less secure these days and I'm shifting more of my systems to ARM. I was going to try installing crouton until I found out that its being deprecated and apparently Google plans to stop making the Chromebook altogether and change the Chrome OS into a hybrid of Android and Chrome OS. Another big reason to avoid all versions of the Chromebook.",2,4,5,4,5

Well it was dead so I try to charge it and it didn't so I buy a new charger. Well that didn't work either so after many attempts I realized the charging port stopped working (Idk how) but I call support to see if Asus would replace it or fix it and I got some of the worst customer service and he kept saying I probably threw my laptop and that I shouldn't be cheap and just buy a new one.

1900,"Great machine for the price. I had a similar Acer that I was a bit too rough with and it only had 2GB RAM. It was a great machine too. I bought this one to replace it.

1903,3 days old and locking up on Witcher 3 on med settings. Not what I paid almost $1000 for.,1,0,1,2,2
1904,"The product meet my expectations. I use it, basically, to surf the internet and its a very fast computer for the price !It has very few signs of having been used. The appearance is 90 - 95% newCons.Charger looks very cheap and its noisyIts an old model so it's heavy, but seems to be strong.Touch pad doesnt Work - or is not activated (I do not care and do not try to fix it)",2,2,3,4,3
1905,"Exceptional laptop. With that 8th gen Core i5, it's such a pleasure to use this for anything (heck, I was playing a freaking 8K video and a 4K video at the same time and it still wouldn't drop frames), all while battery life is absolutely great. The chassis is sturdy yet very light weight. Really not much to complain about. If you want a lightweight, premium, top performance ultrabook, this is the one to get.My only gripe was that the display seemed to have a bit of green tint, very noticeable when compared to my phone's calibrated display or the Samsung Chromebook Pro I tried for a while, but lowering the Green contrast to 46 from 50 in Intel Graphics settings solved it. I also bumped the saturation just +5, and the screen looks gorgeous nowvery similar to my small Pixel 2 which is very well calibrated. Only tip is to uninstall ASUS Splendid Video Enhancement Utility as it doesn't allow Intel Graphics Settings to stay after sleep or reboot for some reason, probably because both have calibration options and conflict with each other.With the display fixed, this thing is 10/10. Fan noise is actually very low or non existent in most tasks. Only when I put it under heavy load (like syncing 12,000 files on Google Backup & Sync) do you hear it and even then it's not annoying. And the touchpad does accidentally trigger 'double tap and drag' when you don't want to a few times, but honestly I usually disable 'double tap to drag' because I rarely drag and when I do, it's more natural to click and drag instead of double tapping.This is a great buy that will last you for a long time given the sturdy chassis and future-proof specs.",3,3,3,2,4

It seemed like a pretty simple issue to me, replace the graphics card. It took 6 weeks for the manufacturer to look at it and get it back to MSI (I thought they were the manufacturer?). They replaced the graphics card. It was fine at first, but the problem is creeping back again...idk if i should send it back in again!

The Built-In Fan (im so sorry i dont know what you called that) seems not working properly unless you make the back side of the laptop elevated. The speakers is good and i have no problem with that. The black version is easy to scratch and your finger prints will be surely all over once you touched it. The graphics is good, it perfectly runs games smoothly.My sugesstion is buy this PC if youre an MMORPG gamer or an FPS. Dont buy this if you love to play MOBA games, because an regular match on MOBA games last 60 min and it will already drain 40% - 50% of your battery.*I lost my old amazon account thats why you cant see the verified purchase logo (or something)*",1,0,1,2,2

This PC has taken everything I could throw at it in terms of editing and elrecording and barely uses any system resources. Screen clarity and quality is great, especially compared to higher priced MSI computers. Bright and vibrant. Built in speakers are not the greatest, especially when they are aimed at your stomach/chest most the time. Would strongly suggest adding the Predator Accessory kit to your cart if your buying this laptop. You get a ton of power and performance in a very inexpensive machine.",2,0,1,0,1
1917,"I thought I should ignore the bad reviews, as there were a few glowing ones - and still try the computer.I hated everything about it. The keyboards backlight didnt work well, the webcam for Skype kept cutting out in the middle of video calling and the sound was also subpar.The most frustrating thing however, was how slow everything is. After deleting the bloatware it seemed to do nothing to improve the speed. Ive never returned an item to amazon before and hopefully the return is proceessed soon.TL;DR: save your money for a laptop of better quality.",1,0,1,2,2
1918,"Very happy with this purchase! Definitely a solid laptop for a very fair price. I'm able to run tons of programs for general professional tasks like office apps and emails at once with out any slowdown and works seamlessly. Also as far as running games - it can definitely run most Xbox 360/PS3 era games quite well. I've been playing GTA IV and Fallout 3 connected on my TV and it looks great. But any games with a lot going on and intense graphics have some slowdown, Sonic Generations for example. I wouldn't bother trying to run something like The Witcher 3 or PUBG on this though.",1,4,1,3,2

1972,"This review is for the Asus L402WA-EH21 14"" laptop.To start off I just wanted to say that I've been researching the low priced laptops for a while and finally decided on this one. Unfrotunately most of the reviews on Amazon are for the smaller screen Asus laptop which is totally different than this one.The first thing i noticed when i got it was that it was not a fan-less design. Even though you could not see any vent holes, you could instantly hear the fan inside the laptop running. THe laptop would get really hot in that section so having it sitting on your lap would not work for an extended perido of time.I tried to like this laptop, however after about a week of use I could not stand it. The battery life was insanely horiblle. At full charge the laptop would show 2 hours and 30 minutes of lifespan. After watching videos online or doing anything that is CPU intensive the battery would drop down to about 85% after about 10-15 minutes of usage and it would show remaining time as 1:40 minutes.Bascially the laptop would only last 2 hours with normal usage - Browsing web, watching youtube etc. That is totally unacceptable. My previous 11"" Asus had a battery life of over 8 hours!I ended up returning this laptop and getting one that costs a little bit more ($399) and flips into tablet mode, also made by Asus. Twice as fast, and battery life is about 6 hours and 30 minutes. Go for that one.",3,1,5,4,3
1973,"This is a great laptop that cna handle most AAA titles at high - max settings. Now no, it is not compared to a 8700K 2x 1080ti in SLI becuase it is a laptop.

1974,"Overall a great gaming laptop for people who can not afford to spend a lot of money on high end gaming machines. There are many good things about this laptop. It is powerful enough to handle pretty much anything that I throw at with ease. The speakers are solid enough to get the job done but don't expect anything that will blow you away. So far I have not had any issues with overheating while playing games. Although I do have few minor cons for this laptop, the power and the build quality definitely make it a worth while purchase. One issue I have with the laptop is the screen. It is not the worst screen you will ever see by far but it is just mediocre. Second, the laptop is a bit heavy but it is understandable given all the power you are getting. Lastly, battery life could be better at around 5 hours of light usage. If the battery life and screen were better, it would basically be the perfect laptop.",1,0,5,2,2
1975,"The major draw back is the short battery life, only about four hours between charges. Since I rarely use it outside my home this is not a deal breaker, however if you need a laptop that you use for extended periods away from an AC source I'd take heed.",2,4,1,2,1

1986,"First off, I want to say that I am incredibly happy with my purchase. After doing a lot of research on laptops with great build quality, specs, and price, I settled on the Acer Predator 17. The amount of sheer horsepower this laptop has is simply incredible. You can easily run any game on max settings with 70+ FPS. I'm really enjoying playing Fortnite, Dark Souls 3, Overwatch, and Witcher 3 on maximum graphics and buttery smooth framerates. With my opening remarks out of the way, let me get started on the details!In my review, I'm going to try to break down each aspect of this laptop to help you make an informed purchasing decision.-----------------PREFORMANCE: 10/10Okay, I pretty much already said this in the intro, but this laptop is an absolute MONSTER in terms of sheer power. This is rocking a 7th gen intel i7 7700HQ and a NVIDIA GTX 1070. If you're not caught up on hardware, let me just tell you that these specs are simply incredible. Nvidia's new Pascal GPU arcitecture on the GTX 10-series really shines through and gives you beautiful performance in all gaming tasks. The processor is incredible as well. Additionally, you're also given 16 GBs of RAM and a nicely sized SSD, so boot up times are speedy and you can run plenty of software concurrently.KEYBOARD AND MOUSE: 10/10This is not something I can explain to you in a review. This is something you have to experience in person. The keyboard and touchpad on this laptop are seriously top notch. The keyboard has a nice, satisfying click with substantial feedback and a nice, quiet clack sound; it really feels like a quality piece of hardware. Same goes for the trackpad and the buttons.Oh, and the rainbow backlight is absolutely incredible. Its something you have to see in person to appreciate.DISPLAY: 7/10The display is beautiful with vibrant colors and good brightness, but there are a few issues I want to point out. First, lets just say it  it has a 1080p display. You can see individual pixels if you look closely, and frankly thats not a good thing. I dont mind that they didnt go for a 4k display, but even a 1440p monitor would have fixed this problem.Apart from being low definition, another issue with the display is the refresh rate and latency. This laptop has a refresh rate of 60hz with G-SYNC, which means you can never have any games appear higher that 60fps, even if your GPU can handle rendering it at higher FPS. The latency is about 20ms, which means the display is about 0.02 seconds delayed on everything you do. This is fine for me, but serious gamers might not appreciate it.Overall the display is very vibrant and good enough for the most part.DESIGN: 6/10I know this appeals to a lot of gamers, but frankly I think its over the top and Id prefer a sleek black design. Seriously, who wants to go to Starbucks and open up their huge 17 laptop with bright red LED backlights and the words PREDATOR imprinted on the back? Youre going to look like a goon, its a simple as that. Some people might like it, but personally its not for me.BUILD QUALITY & COOLING: 10/10This thing feels solid and substantial. I dont know what else to say other than that in terms of build quality. It just feels great! As for cooling, the laptop ships with an extra fan that you can replace the DVD drive with. This keeps all computer components at a nice cool temperature even during the most demanding tasks. Fantastic build quality and cooling overall.ANNOYANCES:There are a few really annoying issues with this laptop. First and foremost, THERE ARE NO VOLUME ADJUSTMENT HOTKEYS. This means that if you want to change the volume while you're in a game or watching a movie, you have to Alt-Tab to the desktop and change the settings manually. I find this to be an EXTREME NUISANCE. I recently downloaded a program that lets me adjust volume from anywhere with Ctrl + Down / Up arrow, but this is not something I should have to install myself.Next, this laptop is really heavy. Its a bit inconvenient to carry around and its very tough to fit in a normal sized backpack.OVERALL RATING: 9/10All gripes aside, when it comes down to the actual computing part of this computer, its simply amazing and you wont find anywhere near as good a price for similar specs and build quality. When it comes down to it, the Acer Predator 17 is a fantastic choice for a gaming laptop, and if you get it I guarantee youll be extremely happy with your purchase decision.-----------------I hope this was helpful!

Fist thing I noticed: there is some pretty bad blacklight bleed on the screen. The processor also makes a very loud and unsettling electrical sizzling noise. It can be heard all the way across my living room when the computer is just idling on the desktop. It gets even louder the more you stress the processor, and it's a very high pitched whine. If you have high frequency hearing loss you may not even hear it, but for me its unbearable.I have monitored the temps on the CPU while doing various tasks with the computer. Doing anything more than web browsing makes the temps jump above 70C, and the fan is constantly whining.I kept testing out the laptop to try and figure out what was up, and in the process I got several BSODs, and the battery strangely went from 74% to 0% while the laptop was just sitting on my desk for a couple of hours.Something is definitely wrong with the power delivery system, or the CPU. I have requested a replacement, but have not yet heard anything back fro Amazon. I really hope I am not stuck with a defective machine.I really want to love this machine. The specs, design and build quality are exceptional. I am truly hoping that I can get a working replacement and can update my review.",3,2,2,0,3
1994,"PROS:1. This is my third Asus - all are still working, just old. I've been pleased with reliability, performance, and battery life on all - and especially this one.2. Very light.3. Fast.4. Good screen size for small laptop.CONS:1. Power button is upper right - where you expact to hit the delete key. (Delete key is to left of it) I had to put a cardboard flap over the power button since every time I went to delete I turned off the PC.2. I like having discrete Home, Page Up/Down, End keys - but it is okay to use CTRL and the arrow keys for that - just took a minute to get used to.OTHER:1. Was a little hard to get used to the keyboard, the keys felt a little far apart - like I needed bigger hands. But after a couple of days, no problems.2. Not a big fan of Windows 10, extra clicks to get most basic tasks done. OneNote does not work properly with it. But that is not Asus' fault.3. I thought the screen was too dim and was a complaint - but then realized that I needed to change the power settings. Now the screen is nice and bright.4. Fan is only loud-ish when doing virus scans or something intensive, otherwise very quiet.",3,3,3,2,4
1995,"The best laptop we ever owned. I bought for my wife to replace macbook air, she uses it everyday, no issue and great windows experience. I sometimes uses it for a few minutes (as second user) and windows hello logs me in quickly. In general, best laptop on market.",0,2,3,2,4
1996,"The laptop functioned fine and was quick and responsive for the evening that I had it and had all the same specs as what I ordered. However, like a lot of the other reviews, I found the display quality to be terrible. It has more light bleed than my MSRP $300 laptop, color accuracy is low, brightness is low, and the viewing angles are terrible. The overall effect is a dull, imprecise display with only one angle where you can see what's on the screen. It makes no sense to put such a poor screen on a gaming laptop, even if the GTX 1050 isn't top of the line. Count on needing to hook up an external monitor to enjoy your visuals.A possible detractor for any potential buyer may be the red backlit keyboard AND red lettering. I wasn't expecting this to be such a pain in the neck to use, but I basically could not see the keys without leaning in. A minor annoyance if you type from memory, but I still do not know why anyone would put a red backlit keyboard on a laptop. As this is more personal preference, I haven't docked the rating for this.While the build is not phenomenal (it's plastic), I couldn't find any obvious structural weaknesses, and for the price I thought it was really good. Still, it's not rugged and you will need to be careful with it. I ended up returning it because of the display, and though I did have to pay return shipping, the seller treated me right, so no complaints there.",1,0,1,2,2

1998,Just an incredible machine. I don't get impressed often but this device definitely made the cut. I had never heard of MSI before when I purchased it I just searched Amazon for gaming laptop and this was one of the results. The other day I just saw them advertised in Walmart.

2000,"So far i'm impressed with this laptop. I have not run a game on it yet but all web pages only take about 4 seconds to load tops. The fan for this is also dead quiet. one thing that is disappointing, my wireless mouse does not work on the very smooth surface of this laptop. My old dell was textured and it worked fine. The only surface it will work on is the built in mouse itself. Also when i'm on YouTube and I start a video it does a 5 second glitch fest when starting and ending a video. I think its just starting computer hiccups. One thing that I really like is the back-lit keyboard. Iv'e never had one and now that I do it's super cool. I do hope dell looks at this review about the wireless mouse not working. that was a bummer because now ill have to cut out a mouse pad to it's shape and if I leave it in the laptop wont close and it's gonna be really annoying to carry a round. I hope I find more amazing things about this laptop as I explore.========================================UPDATE============================================================I am becoming displeased with this laptop. I was trying to play a game called Stardew Valley (AMAZING GAME by the way) and whenever I had to shut it to do something else the screen would freeze and I would have to restart it, losing all my progress since last save. and sadly in stardew valley there isn't any save button.

2006,"EDIT 12/02/17-- I have returned this item to purchase the next model up (i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and a 256 GB SSD). While the base model was fast and was fine with my normal tasks, I couldn't get over the 4GB of ram at this price range. I returned the laptop because I'm afraid that a few years down the road, this won't be enough memory to last. I purchased the next model up from microsoft's website as it was on sale. For an extra $200 I get the better, mid-tier, model and peace-of-mind with the 8GB of RAM and the bigger hard drive. I highly recommend that if you're going to spend this much money, save up a little more and get the mid-level surface laptop.To preface, I bought this computer at my local best buy for $900, and it came with a microsoft Arc bluetooth mouse (it's awesome). I purchased the base model with an i5 processor, 4 gb of RAM, and a 128 gb SSD. I bought this laptop because the look of the computer really struck me. As for the internals, at $900 you could probably get a better laptop. The processor so far appears to be good, and the SSD is blazing fast.The only thing that concerns me, is the 4 GB of RAM. Only having chrome open, with two chrome tabs the memory is already at 50% usage in task manager. I didn't buy this laptop to be a work house and do crazy video editing or gaming, I bought this to do simple things like browse the internet.The screen is insanely clear, I compared this to my macbook pro retina early 2015 and I actually prefer this screen over my mac. The keyboard is nice to type on, and the audio/sound of the laptop is more than adequate. The laptop itself is very light and easy to move, it reminds me of a macbook air.I'd say that, if you are considering this laptop, do your research and know what you're getting into. It's an expensive computer, but it looks DAMN good. If you only plan to use this laptop to use chrome and do other basic tasks, I would recommend the base model.P.S. None of these computers have scalabilty. Meaning you can't purchase more RAM or a bigger hard drive and install it.",0,2,3,2,4

They used cheap components on the inside, making it look like Apple on the outside but giving you cheap Mong Kok / TST / Kowloon alleyway quality insides.How do I know?- OVERHEATING.

2027,"When you purchase this laptop, allow yourself a full day to set it up. First you will need about 3 hours to charge the battery, then Windows updates will take a couple of hours. Then it will take some time to get rid of the junk that all new computers come with (I'm not a gamer, so lots of games had to go). If you are a Windows 10 pro, then you should be good to go. The last Windows computer I had was XP, so Win 10 took a while to get used to. I won't trade my Mac for anything, but I was at the point where I needed a new laptop to take on appointments with clients, and since they are all PC users it only made sense to go with a Windows machine.The computer isn't really gold at all, but more of a silvery color. I was worried that it would be flashy and ""in your face"" gold, but it is very subtle.The caps lock button doesn't let you know it is on, and that can get annoying when you accidentally hit it. There is also no separate numerical keypad, but maybe that is normal for laptops. I am more of a desktop user.Fingerprint technology is great, although about half the time it doesn't recognize me the first time and I have to do it again. Still, much faster than typing a password. Startup is super fast, literally only a few seconds. I was initially only looking for a $400 or so laptop since this won't get much use, but I am glad I splurged and got something with a much better processor and a SSD for the operating system.This laptop weighs next to nothing, and the screen is about the thickness of a few pieces of cardstock. Really, it's very impressive. I am still on my first battery charge, and have probably gotten 5-6 hours out of it, but it is warning me now that it is low.The only downside so far is no DVD drive. But I picked up an external Asus Zen Drive (SDRW-08U7M-U) for $29 and it works great. I don't need it often, but my iMac doesn't have a drive either, so now I am all set for both computers since it is plug and play.Overall, I'm very impressed and glad that I chose this model out of the 40+ I looked at on amazon before deciding. I was worried that it wouldn't have enough RAM, and apparently your warranty is void if you put more in. But so far it is very adequate. If, after trying to run Photoshop and a bunch of other programs all at once it seems to be lagging, then I will update my review.",1,2,1,2,3

2044,"The kind of user I am: I live in the cloud, use almost all Google services, have been using a Chromebook Pixel as my primary work computer for about 3 years now. I have an Apple imac at home and a Windows laptop too, although I dont remember when last I turned on my windows laptop. Oh, and I know a thing or 2 about consumer electronics from a past job.For a user like me, this chromebook is *almost* perfect. If I could, I would give it 4.6 stars. You'll find from the other reviews the pros and cons described more comprehensively, I'll just focus on a few things:*** The cons I kind of disagree with ***- hardware ""bugs"" (e.g. speaker cracking, etc): I haven't personally experienced any of them. I do have one (super minor) issue with the sealing of the bottom aluminum sheet, so I just ordered a replacement, but honestly, at this stage I think I would rate the HW as top notch (given the price point)- Software ""bugs"" (e.g. android apps not always working perfectly...): I did experience a number of them... but I do not see that as an issue for 3 reasons. (1) the availability of (almost all) the Android apps I care about on this makes it effectively a wonderful tablet+laptop replacement, so in the grand scheme of things... I can live with a few bugs here and there (2) I trust that these bugs will disappear over time and (3) I have not yet found any ""critical"" bug for my work (/play) flows- keyboard ergonomics: agree it takes a bit to get used to the layout. given that I do use a full keyboard in parallel (when sitting at my desk I switch to a desktop keyboard), I am still sometimes hitting the wrong key when wanting to press backspace. But again, i see this as a very minor issue. Overall, the keyboard ergonomics are top notch given the size- backlighting of keyboard (lacks it): I was bummed about that initially (I often work in the dark). In practice, this is NOT an issue I have: the keys are sufficiently reflective and the screen sufficiently bright (at the right angle) that I can type effortlessly in the dark. I am typing this review in pitch dark room with screen brightness at 3 and I can effortlessly read all of the keys*** my cons or why I would give it 4.6 and not 5 ***- the trackpad is good (should I say great) but not perfect. I am expecting a stellar trackpad. This is almost but not it.- the speakers are weak. works totally fine, but I want more- the screen bezels are too large: the display is AMAZING, now I want more of it in the same form factor. In particular, at the bottom of the screen, there is currently 1 inch of vertical space (the part where the Samsung logo sits) that screams for becoming part of the actual display*** my pros or why I give it such a high rating ***They got the basics right: battery life is stellar, screen is stellar, size/weight top notch, keyboard very comfortable, trackpad works really well, it is appropriately powered, the memory and storage are sufficient to just not have to think about it.It is truly a convertible that is replacing 2 devices (laptop & tablet) without making compromises I can't live without). I LOVE this.Their bells and whistles actually help! microsd port is great to have, and so is the stylus (I thought of it as gimmicky, but I actually use it almost every day)price point is really good for that kind of quality",2,4,5,4,5

2050,"First off, let me share my wife's testimony, ""This is the laptop of my dreams."" She's the one using it most these days, and has had a few clunkers over the years, so is thrilled by how well this works. I use it on occasion too, and I'm also the one who set it up, and deals with tech issues in our house. First, the two (literally just these two) complaints: the vent near the bottom back can get pretty hot if it's on your lap and if it's on your lap and you open it up, the screen might pinch your thighs. Other than those, this is really flawless for its purpose. Some have critiqued it for not allowing upgrades or personal fixing, which I get as I've repaired more than a few laptop hardware issues. But, very few people have an interest or capability for doing that, and the tradeoff is how thin and light this is.It's not a gaming laptop, it's a productivity laptop and for that, it's wonderful. My personal main laptop is aDell XPS9350-10673SLV 13.3"" 3200x1800 Laptop (Intel Core i7-6560U 2.2GHz Processor, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SDD, Windows 10 Microsoft Signature Image) Silver, and that's what I'm comparing this Surface laptop to. I have pictures which show the relative size. The Surface is more square, providing a larger overall screen, it's also thinner and lighter, not surprising given that it doesn't have near the same specs as the Dell. That said, my Dell is mostly overkill as I tend to keep the resolution on it from max because it's too much for too small of a space for most things (except watching movies) and it has a mediocre battery. The Surface keeps up with almost every task, and if it can't match the Dell 13 on heavy demands, that's not a problem most of the time. The reality of the Surface is that it works, it worked great out of the box, with easy set-up, and continues to be an entirely problem free experience. I would echo the recommendation of others to do the free upgrade from the Windows 10S that this comes with to get it to the regular Windows 10. A few minutes of extra setup time can save some bother and allow more freedom later on. Painless to do, as was the whole process. My wife uses this for browsing, netflix, and also her work-from-home job of captioning, which requires good video and audio. The audio on this is strong and the video is spectactular. The touch screen works fluidly as does the touchpad. This laptop allows us to use it for what we need it for, in ways that are much more user-friendly than anything else I've used. I still personally prefer my Dell 13 for its larger hard drive and more memory. I also like the Dell for having a USB-C, and am surprised Microsoft decided against that. Battery life is really strong, going all day really. This is a perfect work or school laptop, really allowing to maximize productivity without sacrificing anything. It's not the best for hardcore gaming, but that's not it's purpose. If you need a capable, trustworthy, easy to use laptop, this is a very good choice.",0,2,3,2,4

2059,"Very good item, sleek easy to use, very light. Design is very good.Down side bit slow for an i5 from the beginning, also there is this irritating fan/ hard disk spinning noise(like its out of place). Its pertinent with all of these model not just with mine thats how its manufactured I checked it and even other reviews say that.Battery backup is not as expected I think it doesnt even last of what is claimed.",2,2,1,2,3
2060,"Slowest computer that I have ever owned. It took all day to set up. They failed to send me the Microsoft office product key, the only fix that the manufacturers and Amazon offered is to return the whole computer. Waiting another week to have today and another day wasted in the future does not sound good to me. That would waste all my product keys for other programs and I would be hoping that the next computer would be sent with the office key next time.Also I do not recommend Windows 10s, it does not let you download any program outside of the Windows app store",3,1,5,4,3
2061,"Excellent laptop, ignore the bad reviews. Not a lot of bloatware and the TN screen is not a big deal and you get a faster refresh rate than IPS also easy on the eyes. The video card does great on high end games at top settings with no freezing, the TI version is not exactly better, just better in some areas. I'm very impressed with it and if it is not enough room on the SSD then do what I did and buy another 256 GB (SATA) on crucial along with an 8 GB DDR4 2400Mhz stick of ram and it's a Ferrari. Get a good free antivirus like avira, get rid of some of the bloatware but be careful not to delete anything with drivers, and if you plan to video capture leave the Xbox app. I really can't believe the bad reviews, even with the addons your under a grand with a very high end machine. The charger is long and has a nice power light along with the slick look of the keyboard and red backlights which actually looks great so if your contemplating this vs an asus or the hp omen like I was I'd def go for this one again. Oh and the fans are pretty quiet and effective along with easy to clean since you have one screw on the bottom of this and run a plastic pry tool around the edge and your into all the hardware. Also it boots in about 5 secs and I have a lot of programs booting on startup just to see how it would handle it. Great buy at this price since a lot of other choices have a hybrid drive or optical with under 200GB SSD or none at all, also the Ram speed is 2400 and capable of 2666 MHz according to crucial with 32 GB MAX (2 slot ) Hope this helps someone!",1,0,3,2,2

Windows 10 and Office 365 comes preloaded saving hours of download (yea!)... just add accounts and passwords. Seamless link to existing wireless hardware and drivers.I've purchased 3 ZenBooks.

2066,"This is a good-for-the-price budget laptop, but has some functionality issues, as far as I'm concerned.Let me get a few things out of the way right now so that you can skip this review if it isn't appropriate for you. First, we are a primarily-Mac household. Second, we aren't gamers. If you are Windows-only, or gamers, etc., you can ignore a lot of my criticism because I'm just coming from a different perspective from you.When offered this laptop as part of the Vine program, I accepted because it is always nice to have another computer around as a floater. Guests don't always travel with a computer, and this way, they don't just have to rely on their phones or tablets. Besides, another screen never hurts to have around. Like I said, though, we are mostly Mac users, and not gamers. I'll spare you a recounting of the technical specifications because you can look those up elsewhere. At $500, you are pretty much getting a bargain on computing power here-- no arguments from me on that.Set-up was fussy, though, and while I haven't timed operations, simple tasks like start-up, or even opening up Chrome for some simple web-browsing just take longer on this than on a 3-year-old MacBook Pro that I've been beating into the ground. The track pad just doesn't respond like it does on a Mac, and I miss the multi-functionality that you get with a Mac's track pad. The button is stickier too. All of this adds up to a less pleasant user experience. (Yes, Mac's trackpad allows everything you can do with a PC two-button mouse, so quit whining about that).Are these nit-picks? Yup. Absolutely. This is a $500 laptop with a 2.5 GHz processor and I'm whining about the trackpad and Chrome loading slowly because I don't like Windows. I'm THAT guy...The display isn't the best, but you know what? You can send a 1080p signal somewhere else. We even ran it through our projector to play a blu-ray when our blu-ray player got annoyed with us. So, as a floater computer, this thing did its job for us. Again, it's $500.MacBook Pros currently start at $1300. This is $500. I'm being a jerk by pointing out that the trackpad is better on the Mac, and that the ASUS starts up more slowly. Oh, and the Macs no longer come with built-in optical drives. This is a more sensible, budget-conscious machine. It just doesn't give you the same user experience.I'm a jerk. I know. No, I don't have a man-bun or wear skinny-jeans, but thanks for asking.",2,2,1,2,2

It took forever to boot up just to start doing anything. Launching the internet felt worse than dial-up. The internet application (Windows Edge, I think) froze while typing an email, and I had to restart the computer. I had a full wifi connection - so it was the application - not my internet speed. I used it for less than an hour and was so frustrated that I started the return process with Amazon (on my wife's MacBook Pro). It's taken over an hour to only complete ""3% of the factory reset"". I only completed setting up my mail account on this laptop, nothing else -- so the restoration to factory settings should only take seconds. Do not buy this computer.",3,2,1,4,2

It also offers a full keyboard for functionality with making documents. It even has a DVD drive for video viewing.Beyond that, it is kind of only good for stationary desktop replacement type of work. the comptuer reminds me of the type we used 10+ years ago, the big clunky ones that are laptops in that they could sit in your lap, but you honestly wouldnt want them too because they are so heavy and big. Unlike todays thinner frame lighter SSD ones that have ditched disc drives, this one opted to put it back in, went with a big screen, and no touch screen features to deliver the maximum in price reduction. I think its great as a ""my first laptop for college"" for some folks but I wouldnt really use it as an actual portable pc unless Im always going to be able to put it on a desk or table.Viewing angle of the screen could be better, you really only get a good view if youre sitting head on, but if youre sitting even a few degrees over center you get the washed out view.",2,2,4,4,2

2082,"This refurbished product has some ""bad actors"" who are selling D-Grade and Dead on Arrival junk out there, and they do need identified and snuffed out. If folks start listing the seller that sold the Chromebook (Hint: it's NOT Amazon. This is a marketplace sale, it's somebody else.) then maybe they can lose sales and folks will be happier.So, here's a start: don't click on ""Add to Cart"", but instead click on ""See all purchasing options"" and pick a vendor other than the cheapest price. For example, the one I got from DIGJUNGLE. It's a good refurb. New screen, reconditioned battery, and the case is in great shape. It's not brand new quality, but NO REFURBISHED product really is. The case on this one has been cleaned very well, and still has some greased fingerprints and pen marks. But I expect that from a used device.It started right up and the Chrome logo was the first thing I saw. This device was ""powerwashed"" before shipped, so when it was turned on it was the 'New User Experience' asking for a Wi-Fi network and user account login. I checked all the ports for connection and they all worked. Headset jack is also in good shape. The file manager shows no files left on the device when checked. Photos included will back me up on these findings.In short, if you do get a bad machine, post an appropriate review. Please, let's kick the rocks out of here. And you do have my sympathies, the restock fee should not apply to a DOA device or something that looks like it was ran over or left at the bottom of a quarry for three years, but that's between the reseller and the customer, unfortunately. Amazon is a middle man, all they can do is impact the seller from doing business on here again, since it's tarnishing their brand every time this happens. (eBay is falling apart for the same tactics, unfortunately.)But the ones who do good work should keep on selling. If you get a good machine, list the seller in the review so folks who are doing their homework can pick them and skip the machines rescued from a dumpster fire. I had a good experience from DIGJUNGLE. You might have a good one from someone who isn't selling at the cheapest price (go $20-30 higher than the cheapest if you can). But it's still a dice roll.",2,2,5,4,3

Some Amazonians received a ""Chinese only"" Windows version, I did not.Out of the package the laptop looks great. Not super flashy, overall its aesthetically pleasing. When you open the lid you are met with a well designed Steelseries Keyboard. The laptop has a large palm rest area, almost too big imo, they could have spaced out the keyboard a bit better. I dont use laptop touchpads, but this one is one I would consider keeping my mouse unplugged for while web surfing and youtubing.Performance for the price is tough to beat. Beefy i7, little skimpy on the RAM only 8GB DDR4, easily upgradeable. Has the nVidia GTX 1050Ti 4GB GDDR5, the screen looks great no bleeding or anything, most laptops in this price range have just the 1050 or even lower specd GPUs. Also has 2 drives, a 128GB m.2 SSD which houses the Windows 10 OS, very speedy, I would buy a larger 2.5"" SSD to replace the slow 1TB.I havent pushed this laptop yet, and I dont really plan on it, I have seen other users on youtube get the CPU up to 91C, so it may get too hot for your lap.Battery life is going to be atrocious, and I fully accept that, I plan to stay plugged.I am very pleased with my purchase of this laptop, for the price and specs, I dont think you can pass on it.",2,0,1,2,2

No, it's not 4K but I have little need for that in a laptop. 8gb of RAM powers the hungry Windows 10 just fine for everything I throw at it, which admittedly isn't incredibly demanding, but I also have a laptop that crawls along on 2gb RAM in Windows 10 making for a pretty miserable experience. My daughter draws on the computer a lot with a Wacom tablet and never encounters any issues. (This computer did NOT come with the pen. We'll buy one someday soon.)Using this laptop as a kind of tablet just isn't a great experience. Microsoft really hasn't been able to nail down a good tablet experience on a touchscreen PC just yet, but it is kind of handy when doing things such as drawing as I, at least, would rather touch the surface of the drawing rather than use a Wacom tablet.

2100,"I absolutely love this capable little machine - it is well, well worth $200! I have installed some older and less resource-intensive games, MS Office 2016, iTunes, etc. on it and it runs everything well enough for everyday use. This has replaced a much more expensive and larger laptop - if you need more storage, put an SD card in! The machine came with very, very minimal bloat (I uninstalled Candy Crush and Office 365 and that's it!).* KEYBOARD/TRACKPAD: Utterly *fantastic* for anything even close to this price range and rivals those on machines triple the price. They're both responsive, the keyboard has good key travel and is a delight to type on. Gestures on the trackpad are smooth, mousing is crisp. ASUS got it perfect with this.* SCREEN: Also quite capable as an 11.6"" 720p setup. I watched some HD sports, Netflix, and YouTube all without complaint. Picture looks great and you can customize the color profiles if you like it more saturated, etc. Out of the box though - looks great!* BATTERY: *Spectacular!* I can easily get through a full day's casual use with this. 8-10 hours is expected with constant use. The charger is proprietary but reversable. This is a game-changer machine from top to bottom.* POWER: The quad core Intel/4gb RAM combination is great, and often you can't even find Chromebooks at this price range with the same setup. The 32gb EMMC storage, while not SSD, is plenty fast.OVERALL: If you're thinking about a computer in the $200-300 range, look no further. I would recommend this over $400-500 15.6"" models all day. If you're considering this particular machine, I could not recommend it highly enough. This is not a ""downsize"" from a larger, more expensive laptop, but rather an upgrade: you're getting amazing battery life, good performance, and several hundred dollars in your pocket. Why even look at Chromebooks in this price range when you can get a full-featured, non-bloated OS?",3,1,5,4,3

2103,"I bought this laptop to decommission a Dall unit from 2012 which served me very well, also being a 15.6 inch. It was pretty difficult trying to find an all around good laptop that fit all my criteria but this one mostly does it all.Build - 80% of the body is a light sturdy plastic. The cover on the screen lid is a metal sheet that makes the lid pretty sturdy. I like the weight of it and it doesn't seem flimsy at all. It looks great and premium has a good selection of ports and a full size SD slot.Screen - I came from a 768p laptop which was the worst, so jumping to 1080p is an irreversible step I've taken. It's very vivid and colors aren't too saturated. The brightness is on the low side and would be nice if it could get about 20% brighter and it is a matte finish and gives very decent angles.Battery - My laptop is usually a desk queen, but I have tested the battery and it's decent. Light use would see about 6 hours of life and hard use would be closer to ~2 hours. The battery time estimate is erratic and sometimes seems inaccurate.Keyboard & Touchpad - So I was expecting to have to relearn a new keyboard but I guess since the main body is only slightly smaller than my last laptop so it's almost basically all the same spacing and everything. There is no function key lock which I seemed to take for granted previously but it's not a big deal. This keyboard is backlit and has 3 different levels of brightness, brightness 1 is enough for me so +1 to that. The keys aren't loose and typing on them is I think satisfying, they're somewhat quiet when pushed. People complain about how the power button is right next to the delete key, but for me personally I don't find this an issue at all.So the touch pad isn't good, your fingers don't slide over it easily, it grabs your finger basically.. really odd. It clicks great, but I won't be trying to use is at all. Would recommend a bluetooth mouse at all times. The fingerprint reader hasn't failed once.Processor & Speed - My model is the i7 7500U... It's basically an i5 7200U but with a .2Ghz quicker clock speed. Still dual core (bummer... thanks intel) and turbo boosts to 3.48Ghz. My base clock speed according to windows and also Intel's own driver software says 2.9Ghz. I wish I had gotten a model with an actual i7 instead of an i5 with an i7 badge. Fan noise is overall quiet until you run something that puts it at over 50% CPU usage but even still, it's manageable. Keep your power settings to 'Recommended' because 'High Performance' keeps it permanently turboboosted @ 3.48Ghz **The model with dedicated graphics would be worth it if you're more than a less than casual gamer.Wireless - Bluetooth is quick to reconnect a mouse when turning on the laptop. At the same spot my last laptop was, this one gets 'excellent' signal whereas my other one would get 'fair' to the sometimes 'good'.Speakers & Sound - So out of the box it doesn't sound good, neither do. You'll need to play music and then adjust the EQ to make it sound nice, but when you do it sounds as good as you can make it. My previous Dell laptop has the best speakers and the best EQ settings for headphones/speakers I've ever heard so I had to make lots of adjustments through the EQ of this laptop to make it sound as close as I can as my last computer. I got it pretty close but still not perfect, but I can live with it! The weird this is this computer comes with like 3 programs that control EQ which is very confusing, AND they all aren't mutually exclusive so they all build on each other. For this reason I recommend doing it though the 'ICEpower Audiowizard' program.",2,2,1,2,2
2104,"Purchased this in April. At first I was very happy with it, it seemed to be pretty good. Had features I liked and wanted. Then about a 4-5 weeks after buying, that's when it all went bad. PHANTOM TOUCHES!!! You'll be using it, and then all of a sudden the display starts to spaz out. Jumping around, phantom key presses. It will continue until you force power it off. Then when you restart it sometimes goes away for awhile. However, it comes back. This is not an isolated issue, it's actually quite common among this Chromebook. Just Google ""Chromebook plus phantom"", and you'll see tons of complaints and videos about it. It's a huge flaw, and Samsung isn't properly addressing the issue. All they do is tell you to send the notebook in to be repaired, which takes like 2-4 weeks. And they don't fix the issue, because it starts all over again. This product is garbage, and Samsung is washing their hands with the issue. Amazon should remove this product considering how widespread the issues are. DO NOT BUY, you have been warned.Pros:- Stylus- Bright, vivid display- Decent keyboard- Build qualityCons:- PHANTOM TOUCHES/KEYPRESSES- Poor connectivity, wifi doesn't always work, even when it shows you're connected- Samsung's lack of support- Not enough cpu/gpu power to drive the high resolution display.

So far I've had none of the perpetual fan running, screeching innards or other cited failings that had nearly kept me from buying it. I have not attempted the fingerprint reader, having enough frustration with that on my Android phone. The only time I noticed the fan was when I was loading software. After that, the fan has been quiet or barely noticeable when it does run.I will admit that I'm not doing processor intensive work. I bought this mostly for a travel computer, and it appears to be ideal for that. It's slim, lightweight and the battery appears to hold a long enough charge that I won't need to haul the charger in my carry on bag, so I'm looking forward to a lighter load on future trips.Although my intention was for travel, as I'm getting used to using it, I'm finding I use it far more for every day work than the travel notebook that it replaced.

I don't need a real powerhouse and just need something to do some diagnostics and remote into my desktop from home if needed. I have a few of the Zenbooks deployed and they seem to be quality machines so I am comfortable with ASUS laptops.I knew that I wouldn't be using Windows so the fact this has Windows Home was not an issue. If I were keeping Windows, I would have went with one that had PRO on it already or upgraded to Enterprise. I took the 5400 RPM drive that Windows was installed on and replaced it with an SSD drive. This laptop has easy access to the hard drive and RAM.I installed Ubuntu Gnome 17.04. The peripherals I use (wireless, LAN, display, trackpad, audio) all work. I didn't try to get the fingerprint reader working.Pros:Powerful for price - I5, 8GB RAM, FHDEasy access to replace hard drive and RAMUbuntu works out of box12 month warranty.

I haven't required any use of the warranty.Cons:If I were going to be closing and opening the lid multiple times every day, I would worry about the hinge area. It feels like every other sub $500 laptop, but that is what this is.Windows Home on a ""PRO"" laptop. I didn't use Windows, but I would expect something labeled as pro and for business to have the ability to join a domain out of the box.A con for me is a cdrom drive. That area could have been better utilized as a space for a second storage drive. Most of the cdroms put in laptops are crap that break with any use.I would buy this laptop again for my use case.",2,2,1,2,2

The little gain in processor speed is not significant and the extra ram 2 gigs if ram is used up by the 64 bit operating system. I think the only real upgrade is the USB 3 port, which most people don't need anyway. Battery life is also about the same. Good machine for surfing the Web and watchingstreaming video.

2127,"Im not a gamer or hobby level computer engineer. This wont be that kind of review.I am a tactile person. I appreciate how things look and feel. I enjoy the feel of quality design, and construction.First let me say I enjoy the aesthetic of this computer. The brushed metal with a matt black, and red accents is both interesting and exciting. This will be the primary computer for my 11 year old. He loves gaming, and graphic design. He is currently working on a comic book, and I know he will make great use of this computer for his creations.I absolutely loved the setup. This is a windows machine. I have not set up a windows machine in years. We have mostly used iPads and iPhones for most of the last decade. Ive purchased and set up many of those. They are simple for sure, but this windows machine made setup interesting. Now maybe that says more about windows than Acer, but its included. I enjoyed it. So its in the review.Why was the setup so interesting? Cortanna. The whole set up was voice controlled. She spoke, I answered, and she did the setup. I felt like I was at a pro desk, having a knowledgeable customer service rep set it up for me.The screen has a matte finish, and feels a little plasticy. This may be a side effect from coming from iPads, which have glass screens. But I think I do prefer the look of glass. I do think the matte finish helps reduce glare. So this computer would likely, literally shine, out doors. Its a bit big, in my view, to be easily portable. But Im sure kids and teens lug these around. I prefer the iPhone 7 Plus for portability. Anything bigger than an iPad mini is staying at home.The machine attaches to WiFi quickly and easily, and with stability. Thanks to google, most of my settings were there after setup and google log in.The back lit keyboard is a neat feature. The keyboard its self provides a nice tactile experience. Key strokes feel fluid, and smooth. The keys feel more rubber or silicone, than plastic. Their motion seems to have been intentionally engineered for a positive user experience.The hardware inside is sufficient for any computer tasks I threw at it. I had numerous windows open at once, everything from shopping, to video streaming, to audio streaming. No hiccups, or glitches.",2,0,3,2,2

2133,"Boy was I disappointed with this thing. Let me go over some quick pros & cons so you can get through this review quickly.+ Amazing build quality: Super sturdy, no screen flex+ Aesthetics: I love the more subdued look, not too ""gamer-y"" for a laptop with a 1050+ Keyboard: Enjoyed the feel and key placements- Screen: Holy crap, this thing is *bad*. I am not a picky person when it comes to screens, but this TN panel is awful. Colors are beyond bad, the screen looks constantly dirty, and the 1080p resolution can easily pass for 900p- Performance & Speed: This thing runs slower than my Mid-2012 MacBook Pro, no joke. I tried living with it, but it's absurdly slow. Even after removing all bloatware and defragmenting the HDD, it still ""runs"" like a slug.- Performance (continued): This carries over into game performance, where I was getting 30-40fps during fights in Overwatch. For those who don't know, a 1050 and i5-7300u are more than enough for something like Overwatch, but I was getting that frame rate even when set to 720p low settings. This is after ensuring all drivers are updated and the game was using my 1050 and not the integrated GPU. I also made sure the laptop was favoring performance. No change. I almost certainly received a defective unit, as this can't possibly be normal.All-in-all, I don't recommend simply based off of my experience. If you buy the SSD variant, don't get a defective unit, and can ignore the ugly screen, it's a nice laptop. But given my issues with speed and performance, I'll be returning my unit and looking elsewhere.",1,0,1,2,2
2134,Good computer. Just really disapointed the number 4 key is sticky and seems almost broken. Might have to exchange/return. Also the color is way off. Not the gold tone in picture. Also found a minor chip. Theres always gonna be something wrong.,3,1,5,4,3

2137,"I purchased this as a replacement laptop for my wife, who games a lot. This was delivered to me with what I believe to be a faulty hard drive. I know everything there is to know about computer hardware, so read on to find out how I attempted to solve the problem.From the get-go, we found boot times to be abysmally slow and performance once inside Windows was just as bad. Sluggish programs that took ages to open, slow installs and transfers and 100% disk usage reported by task manager on a near constant basis. That seemed to me like a sign of an either bad hard drive or Windows 10 being Windows 10. I tried various tweaks to Windows to improve disk performance, but nothing seemed to work. I then ran chkdsk, which found no issues with the (generic WD) drive (you don't want to know how long that chkdsk run took). So I decided to resort to buying a new high-performance hard drive replacement to avoid sending the laptop back and waiting for weeks for a refund or replacement. The laptop performed admirably in games after all, which at least signified that the CPU and GPU have no issues.In the end, a new hard drive seems to have been what was needed. No more taking ages to boot, transfer files and 100% disk usage. Having to spend extra money and stress over having to fix a brand new laptop has me obviously pissed off, though.Another thing I should mention. You CAN run Windows 7 on this laptop, if you change the boot mode to Legacy, but you will not be able to game on it, which is a shame because Windows 10 is an abomination. Intel has not released Windows 7 graphics drivers for this CPU gen (on purpose, to push Windows 10). You can technically find a way around this restriction and install the drivers by modifying the Windows 10 drivers themselves, but they will still be non-functional in this particular model because it has switchable graphics. Thank Intel and Microsoft for this.",1,0,1,2,2

Thanks to Amazon Prime and their return policy I've got the the perfect laptop for my needs.",1,2,1,2,3
2140,"I have been using this computer for 7 months and so far I am beyond pleased with it. The fingerprint scanner has been working flawlessly and is a great alternative to manually entering a password every time. Speed of the computer is very impressive, it is quick and responsive since there is no bloatware loaded. After several months I upgraded the hard drive to a Samsung 500GB SSD. With that upgrade this laptop boots up and loads lightning fast. I have not upgraded the 8gb of memory as of yet but that is forthcoming as I have a tenancy to leave browser windows open in Chrome and that habit utilizes a good amount of memory. I do a light amount of HD video and photo editing and so far the processor and memory has performed well with those task. When utilized on my desk the HDMI is utilized for an external wide screen monitor, so running two screens is not an issue with the graphics card. The 27in monitor I have attached is crisp, clear and responsive.The one flaw that I have with the computer is that with the construction near the memory. When grabbed from the front corner on the left front corner I have had the computer freeze/lock up. The only fix is to force a shutdown when that happens. I have determined that plastic bottom panel covering the memory is pressing into the memory stick which is under the mouse pad and causing it to compress which causes the PC to freeze. I have 4 other ASUS computers (different models) that I use for my business and this is the only one that does this. I just have to be careful when picking it up in the field.Overall a great value and despite its one flaw it is a solid computer that has been holding up well. I would recommend upgrading to an HDD hard drive to boost performance and speed if that is something that is important to you.",2,2,1,2,2

There isn't a caps lock button, so it's going to take some time for me to get used to pressing alt and search. I'm hoping there is a shortcut to this. (I just got it last night). Highly recommend if you are looking for a, as my husband called it, a 'phone w a larger screen and a keyboard'.

It does NOT come with a CD/DVD drive, so expect to spend another $20-50 for a plug in variety if you need one. This laptop does come with a lot of bloatware and I am still working to remove the non-essentials. Overall it feels a little on the cheap (flimsy side) relative to an HP laptop I have at the office, but for light use at home and as a back up to my almost new Dell all-in-one with a dead motherboard, it's fine. Packaging was very poor. There was very little material to cushion the laptop box so it knocked around a lot inside the shipping box, and the shipping box arrived damaged.

2157,"Purchased this Chromebook in mid-March 2017. Loved the quality of the screen. Keyboard not so great.In late-April 2017 the bottom of the screen developed a band of ""static"" (see the picture). I called Samsung and went through a number of troubleshooting exercises with them online (which included a complete ""wipe"" of the computer) and they determined it was a defective video card and said that I needed to send the computer in.It is not June 9 and I still haven't not received my computer back. I have made multiple calls to Samsung and all I have found out is that it has was shipped to another service center since the original one wasn't equipped to deal with the problem and then shipped back to original one and still has not been fixed. They have not been able to give me an estimated time as to when the computer will be fixed and shipped back to me. What they have done is say they are transferring me to speak to a representative in their ""Executive Resolution Department"" followed by 30-40 minutes of hold music and then a hang up. This has happened three times. When I call back they tell me that a member of that department will call me at a specific day and time and then I get no call.Save yourself lots of frustration. Acer makes great Chromebooks. The R11 or R13 would do great in place of this one. The school I teach at has hundreds of Acer Chromebooks that are used 4-5 hours a day by not so careful high school students. They have held up incredibly over the past two years and the couple of times there were problems, Acer repaired the computer under warranty in a matter of days, not months.Samsung has worked very hard to lose me as a customer. I really wanted to give them a chance and I really hoped that they would have resolved this situation. I have suggested to them that they send me a different computer or refund my money since they haven't been able to fix mine but they apparently do not care about customer relations.",2,4,5,4,5

It claims to be able to support Android apps but it is really hard to get it to work at all and then the apps it has are really just junk.

Hopefully no issue from here on in.I know it is not Samsung's fault but the fact that Chome OS blocks 3rd party apps from accessing external storage is a real killer and I would have re-thought this purchase had I known this in advance.

It refused to let me use my password of choice because it was 'seen too often.' Also the MS Edge software continues to intrude itself despite my having made the tried and true MS Explorer my browser of choice.

2171,"This laptop really performs well for the price and is a better option for me vs. Chromebooks in a similar price range as it also of course runs full windows apps. I've read some negative reviews concerning the screen but I'm guess they must be referring to the HD version (1366x768) and not this Full HD version (1920x1080 ie. 1080p). The screen looks very decent and I'm very happy with performance of the m3 proccessor. It's also a great looking machine, feels very well made. In my opinion, the look and feel reminds me of the new Macbook Pros, at a fraction of the cost.The only 2 gripes I have are that the keyboard isn't backlit, and that I can't charge the laptop via USB-C, like with the Asus Chromebook C302CA, for example, but I still prefer the bigger screen (14 vs. 12.5 inches) and just purchased an extra power adapter so that I can leave one at home and one at work.Edit: I forgot to mention that in flip/tent or tablet mode, you can of course type right on the touch-screen in the dark, regardless of the non-backlit keyboard, and it also includes a stylus if you want to avoid fingerprints on the screen!",2,2,5,4,3

Interestingly, there was also a tiny smudge of glue/dirt on the top of the chromebook right out of the box which didn't seem right. As for design, the screen, keyboard, battery life and software are quite satisfactory for the asking price.

They tell me its the future.Unlike many of the other posters mine did turn on. It did let me set it up. I installed an antivirus and a couple browsers. This is where things began to take a turn for the worse.I replaced the old computer because the delay time for actions on it have increased over the last couple months and along with a dying battery it seemed time.Asus and Amazon have delivered here. It takes longer to launch a browser on the new computer than it does on than it does for me to start the old one from totally off and launch the same browser. Pretty much everything on this computer is slow. I tried swapping the AV as I figured perhaps it was slowing things down but alas it naturally slow. I am not asking anything difficult of it, which is good as it is basically a potato.The bottom line is that this computer is junk.

Then you may run into a random issue of an android app misbehaving, which can lead to you powerwashing your system. The only great part about powerwashing your Chromebook is unlike a windows pc it automatically re-installs all add-ons, extensions and android apps (once you give the system permission to use the Google Play Store again).Now onto what I like, the screen...it has great colors, great viewing angles, and it very sensitive to the touch.

I was looking for at least a quad-core cpu, and at least 4 gigs of DDR4 ram. Usually laptops with 8 gigs of DDR4 ram are well over $500. Many budget laptops today still have DDR3 ram, and usually have 4 gigs of DDR3 ram. We might as well future proof our experience with USB Type-C, and AC wifi so our purchase isn't outdated for a couple of years at least. The 1 Terra-byte hard drive is more than enough space for a lifetime, but is also what is holding this laptop back. I went ahead and purchased an external HDD enclosure, and a Samsung evo 850 500 GB solid state hard drive. I transferred my data to the Samsung SSD, installed the SSD into the laptop, and reused the 1 terra-byte HDD which came in the laptop as an external 1 TB drive. This laptop completely starts and is all ready to be used in aproximately 2-3 seconds after pressing the ON button with the solid state drive. With the solid state drive, this machine is really comparable to other laptops which cost $800 and above. I have had my laptop only for about a month, and I love it so far! I am a student, and I primarily use my laptop for research and homework at school, but I also play some games on it too. I immediately purchased a soft neoprene case for this laptop, and put the laptop in the neoprene case, which goes into my padded backpack laptop pocket to protect my investment.

2228,"This is an impressive laptop thats worth your consideration and represents a good value for a few reasons.This is the nicest feeling Acer product Ive reviewed, though Ive reviewed two other Acer computers and an Acer monitor. This seems like a premium product. The external branding is a more muted than on a lot of gaming laptops and this model will not look gaudy in a classroom or office environment. Thats not the case for many competitors, which look obnoxious. The red screen bezel is a muted red, more like an accent, and the only really distinction will be that sweet backlit keyboard. While you can tell this is a gaming laptop at first sight, it still looks professional.Cortana runs windows setup now right out of the box, and its a quick and painless process if you know your Microsoft password. Its a fun experience to unwrap and turn this laptop on and I can see someone really being engrossed over this by a Christmas tree with unwrapped gifts nearby. Not thirty minutes after I got this, and Ive got Office installed to type this review, and Steam is downloading GTA V for testing its real performance.The laptop has a high performance SSD hard drive, with no moving parts, leading to a perception of a very fast system because Windows and your programs will load very quickly, however, theres only 211 gb free on the hard drive. Thats not a problem if you just delete games you arent using, and adding another hard drive is possible. Bear in mind that theres no Blu-ray or DVD drive on this laptop, which is a good thing Id rather have the extra space (where you can install an additional hard drive). This laptop has no moving parts aside from the keys on the keyboard, making the thing feel rock solid yet light for its size. The angular body is the most comfortable laptop Ive typed on because my wrists and the angles just seem to match comfortably as I type. The keyboard isnt the mechanical joy of an old Thinkpad, but its easy to type on with the clearly lit keys, and its quiet to type on. As I write this review, Im typing quickly and easily. The touchpad is quite large and I really its subtle red frame, marking its place even in a dark room. I really like the way this thing feels and looks.I found wifi performance is excellent, particularly with a modern beam forming router. I used this laptop in a building where most wifi devices run into a lot of interference with the old steel construction, but this laptop kept working quite well. I recognize this is hardware overkill for office tasks, however even though Ive got a few other laptops, this is the one I would take to a meeting or to type a paper. The screen is gorgeous! The audio is great for a laptop and I enjoy games and movies, but at home Ill still pair with my Bluetooth soundbar for better bass.So lets sum up things so far: the laptop is very nice to look at, with good sound, a great screen, good keyboard, great mouse, and its comfortable. Its easy to set up and will be the gift of the year on Christmas for a lot of people.The remaining matter is the raw performance. Is this thing really going to play those games well?Well, my first impression was that this laptop was a poser. Half the vents on the laptop are fake, etched in plastic, like a fake air intake on a cheap sporty car. There are two fundamental ways to cool a gaming laptop. Either you run two heat paths, metal and fans and vents, one for the GPU and one for the CPU, or you run a single one. This laptop looks like its the superior dual path version, and I believe Acer designed this case with the possibility of using that solution at a higher price point, but looking at the internals and the vents, its clear there is a single path sharing the CPU and GPUs heat. That means heat will spike and it will accumulate faster. Ill get back to this in a moment.The specs on this laptop are very similar to my desktop machine I built a couple of years ago. My desktop has a quad core i5 processor, slightly faster, and it has a GTX950, the equivalent last generation version of this GTX1050. (GPU numbers can be confusing, but the 9 or 10 in these numbers is the edition, think year of a cars make and the 50 is the model, think Honda Civic). This laptop has 4 gb of video memory to my desktops two, and 4 gb is great, but otherwise the two systems are very evenly matched for performance.On paper, the specs of this laptop are great for playing games. My desktop with very similar specs plays GTA V, Skyrim SE, Echo, and many other modern games with graphics settings set very high, and it does so reliably. This laptop has a slightly more modern GPU, but that generous 4gb should mean excellent performance, actually in the realm of VR games.My expectation was that the cooling system would be overwhelmed quickly, and the laptop would either need to be set to medium settings on games, or I would see a lot of framerate problems, and my desktop, with its equivalent specs but drastically better cooling, would outshine the laptop. So to test this I ran the Unreal Heaven 4.0 benchmark on its most extreme settings on both this laptop and my desktop, in the same room.Again I was really impressed with the screen on the laptop as I ran the benchmark. It just looks great. The laptop noticed the tough test quickly and the fans kicked in, making the laptop sound like a PS4 running hot. It topped off at about 67 degrees C (Which is about as hot as youd want a chip to get to preserve its reliability), and my desktop topped off at about the same point. The systems had both reached their thermal limit and would not push harder, instead dropping performance, which is exactly how they are designed.My expectations of the laptop being crushed by my desktops performance were quickly proven wrong. The laptop was doing slightly better than the desktop, and continued to do so for most of the 26 benchmark tests. At one point, the toughest test, its framerate dropped to 9 frames per second, but on average it did a little better than the desktop. Ive attached a screenshot of the benchmark comparison.So, the bottom line is that the cooling solution isnt the best design, but it is adequate for the GTX1050ti, which is a smaller, more efficient GPU design. Based on how fast those fans kicked in, I think if you use this laptop for gaming you should keep it clean and use a cooling pad, but its performance was rock solid, and that was a complete surprise to me after tearing down gaming laptops for reflows, to repair heat damage, and assembling dozens of gaming computers, which has been a hobby of mine for over 20 years. The single heat path in a gaming laptop really isnt the best but its working in this laptop, and that decision absolutely made it possible to sell this laptop at such a competitive price.I played two of my favorites, Typing of the Dead, and Grand Theft Auto V (on medium to high settings) and after several hours have concluded this is a wonderful experience. Im very tempted to get a VR headset to use with this laptop, which means I have a much stronger impression of its ability to take abuse than I did before I tested it. But if you research the 1050ti for VR you will learn it's really the bare minimum for VR. Just keep that in mind.I conclusion, I love using this for non-gaming tasks, like typing, it looks and feels great, and the performance is impressive. There are compromises, and I think they are well justified by the price. This is a great buy if you dont need the absolute top of the line.Quick Update: After reading the other reviews I decided to grab a spare laptop hard drive and try to install it. I saw that there was a bag of extra screws in the box labelled HDD Upgrade Screws. I removed one long screw from the base revealing a pouch style suspension for an extra hard drive, and a typical SATA cable. I unscrewed that, plugged in the hard drive, and put all the screws back. The hard drive worked just fine in Windows. So it appears these laptops do ship with everything you need to add a second hard drive.",2,0,3,2,2

2235,The only thing this laptop needs is a solid state hard-drive (SSD) and you're good to go. Boots up within 15 seconds. Lenovo will likely comment that swapping out the HD will void your warranty but consider this. You can just as easily re-install the original HD which has Windows and all of their bloatware pre-installed. Then just ship it back for any warranty issues. There is no security sticker over the screw or compartment that holds the HD and installing it takes 5 minutes. Lenovo just wants you to spend an arm and a leg using their techs to do upgrades. Don't fall for that garbage. Watch a Youtube vid if you need to and do it yourself.,1,4,1,3,2
2236,"So, it's not a bad computer. It is slightly annoying to not have a clear separation of the ""left and right click"" bar beneath the ""mouse pad""...Overall, the computer is lightweight, a little slow on the boot up, but looks clear and sharp. The sound is good, but it is still pretty slow in comparison to what I'm used to with my work computer. However, this computer is for my husband rather than me, and he really enjoys it. He isn't the most computer literate and I suppose from his stand point, anything is better than nothing. I've owned Dell Laptops in the past, but for some reason, I've had better luck with my Lenovo and HP.",3,3,2,4,2

2241,"I've used this Chromebook for about 2 days now and wanted to pass along my first thoughts. Keep in mind, I currently own a 2016 Macbook Pro and had a Chromebook Pixel 2. I can tell you off the bat that this is no Chromebook Pixel (one of my favorite devices ever).I'm only giving this device 3 stars as of right now (being generous) because as Google has said.....the software is still in beta mode. From initial boot up, until today..... this thing has resets, freezes and other hiccups all over the place. I see the potential though so I'm not going to be harsh. I spent about 30 minutes composing a message that was suddenly lost due to a random re-boot. Wasn't thrilled.The screen is as beautiful as claimed. Touch sensitivity and quality up there with the Chromebook Pixel. I was pleasantly surprised. The touchpad has a great feel to it and is as responsive as almost any other Chromebook I've used. Still doesn't beat a Macbook glass touchpad though. (I know it's an unfair comparison)Keyboard is just OK with satisfying key travel....but wish it was a bit better. Other reviewers have claimed the keyboard to be a bit cramped which I can attest to. When typing away, the small changes to key size (tab, delete) become apparent and its just something you'll have to get used to. Not a deal breaker.Been getting about 8 hours of battery life. So far so good.Hope this helps with your research. My opinion, wait until the bugs are smoothed out. Maybe by the release of the Pro model (that all black look too) they'll have most of this corrected.I miss my Pixel.",2,4,5,4,5

I need to take this laptop to get it fixed but since I use patient information, I need to protect the files - so that means backing everything off. THEN, I get to sit this on the desktop and buy another new computer (NOT an MSI) that's more sturdy. At the end of the day, double the cost for what could have been the answer to my issues of speed & power to do what I need to do. I'll stick with Lenovo, I guess - they certainly hold up better. I also don't like the hard drive separation - who's bright idea was that? I have to remember to look in the D drive vs. the usual C drive.

2251,"Cons:This thing was a piece of junk from Day 1. They ship it with 1 stick of RAM and a 5400 rpm hard drive. The CPU is only a dual core i5 with magical hyper-threading which does absolutely nothing, so the least they could do is split the memory into a 2 stick configuration for dual channel speed. They don't! DDR4 pricing is also inflated beyond belief. Luckily, they paid for the return shipping label because it was probably more expensive than the keyboard and trackpad. I use a USB mouse because the BlueTooth is so cheap, it disables the WiFi when trying to use both at once. The keyboard shows signs of wear within the first 3 months. The machine as it is sold may as well be a DIY kit laptop because it is useless with Windows 10, without a solid state drive and without 16gb or 32gb DDR4 in a 2-stick configuration. This thing is the Netbook That Never Could. Burn it in a fire. Give me my money back and some flammable fluid. I will do it for free and put up a video.Pros:Ubuntu 18.04LTS works perfectly except for the WiFi and BlueTooth problem which exists indefinitely on any operating system.

2253,"With each passing year, I'm becoming more and more of an ASUS fan. I love the quality, utilitarian build of their products. Everything is no nonsense and I appreciate that at a time when companies are over indexing on unnecessary and unwanted features.// PROSBATTERY LIFE: The low voltage Kaby Lake processor in this laptop means that the battery lasts and lasts. In addition, the battery itself is replaceable, meaning you can carry an extra one. Perfect for travel when charging could happen infrequently.BUILD QUALITY:This laptop looks and feels solid. It's exactly what you want for the rigors of commuting and travel. It would also make a great machine for the kids.TRACK PAD AND KEYBOARD: The track pad on the P2540UA has the perfect responsiveness and includes useful gestures. ASUS has nailed this. Other laptop manufacturers' track pads can be overly responsive to the point where they're difficult to control and cause unwanted clicks and scrolls. The ASUS also includes a full keyboard with keys that have a satisfying travel. This is another area where manufacturers' skimp on lower-end machines, but ASUS has don't a nice job here.EXPANDABLE MEMORY: ASUS has made it almost trivial to add RAM to this laptop. While 8GBs is a great start for a simple productivity machine, the ability to easily upgrade is always welcome. I immediately addedCrucial 8GB DDR4 2400 MT/S (PC4-19200) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory (CT8G4SFS824A)to double the RAM and it took all of 5 minutes.64-BIT WINDOWS 10: This machine comes with 64-bit Windows 10 and allows you to take advantage of everything the OS and Cortana have to offer.NO BLOATWARE: What a treat! This system isn't littered with bloatware.PRICE: This ASUS is phenomenally priced for what you get.// CONSDISPLAY: The display is proving to be lackluster. The viewing angle is poor. You have to manipulate the screen to just the right angle or you lose contrast...significantly. I've found the range of acceptable viewing to have only about 10-15-degrees of freedom. Once you find the sweet spot, it performs ok, but it's poor for any graphics related tasks (or photo manipulation) as the color, contrast, and clarity are not at all there.GRAPHICS: The on-board graphics for this machine uses Intel HD 620, meaning there is no dedicated graphics VRAM. However, you can expand your RAM (see above) and allocate more memory here. An Internet search will tell you how.//SUMMARYOverall, I think this is a great system for business productivity and travel or as a durable machine for the kids. (Heck, it might be ideal that the sound isn't optimal in the latter case. ;) )",2,2,1,2,2

I did a bunch of driver updates and turned the speakers off but it still kinda does it. I was on customer support for almost 2 hours and they were really good but they ended up telling me I needed to ship it back to get fixed. Apparently not everyone has this problem but I did, so it gets 3 stars instead of 5.",1,0,1,2,2

I'm not upset because it is what I expected. I contacted a few sellers before the purchase to verify. None of them could confirm an IPS panel just ""15-inch FHD display"". The one answered question above that states it is an ""IPS"" is from a seller that is selling a $999 model. To be honest the TN panel is great. There are a lot of screen snobs out there that just drool over the the letters IPS. In reality, the screen is fine. Don't stick your nose up to this unless you are some kind of graphic designer and truly need the ""IPS"" screen. I use this machine for programming, gaming, and media consumption and it works great.

2265,"This is a very good laptop pc used for gaming. Since it's my first I do not have much to compare it to, but mostly everything satisfies me.Good:It runs very quick with today's modern games. From GTA V to Cities Skylines, I have no complains to how it runs. The bootup is also good, only takes a couple of seconds. Screen is ok too with displaying colors, again, nothing to complain about. The best part is the service. The first laptop that arrived was defective. The screen was fuzzy upon startup so I needed to return it. After contacting Amazon they had me return it. The problem was that meant I was out of a laptop for a few days. However, they allowed me to purchase another laptop and wait for that one to arrive before I returned the other one.Bad:It's very loud, especially when you play high demanding games. This is good since the computer won't fry, but headphones are almost a must. The battery life isn't all that good even when I'm not running games, maybe a couple hours tops. It smudges easily by fingerprints all around also. It is kind of heavy and thick, which may serve as a problem for those wanting to fit in a lot of cases.Verdictit is a great choice for someone who needs a portable laptop that wants to play games for a low price. While one can build a PC for cheaper, this comes in handy for the college market.P.S. I made this review after having the laptop for a few months.",2,0,1,2,2

2270,"So I just received my laptop yesterday for school and the box was a little damaged nothing major because the computer is wrapped excellently. Now however when I turned it on, it came straight on and Im reading the setup instructions and Im clicking the startup flag in the bottom left hand corner. Still nothing is working, so I googled and still couldnt find anything. So I figured force restarting solves most problems so I force restarted the computer and it came back on then the initial setup that shouldve came on screen the first time appeared. Its a very good computer so far with easy setup especially if youve previously had an Microsoft account to just log into. Seeing as i just received this package last night Ill spend a week and a half testing it out and Ill post an update.***UPDATE.So the speakers crackle. Not only when th volume is loud but low as well. And even though the laptop is new, a new update pops up on my screen everyday sometimes more than one and more than twice a day. Holds a great charge as well. Colors are very vibrant and its good at connecting with your phone and syncing data that you need if you arent near your phone. Havent tried this computer out with my Photography software yet but hopefully it wont let me down!!",3,1,2,4,2

The keyboard is small and takes some getting used to, but it's easy once you get the hang of it. Would buy it again in a heart beat.Only draw backs: it's not really gold, it's more light rose gold and the charger plug-in is a little difficult to plug into the laptop itself. Also, it does not come charged so you cannot use it right away. Manual said to let it charge for about 3 hrs before first use.Battery seems to last longer than 7 days, if you don't use it everyday.I purchased a Logitech mouse to go with it from Target and have had no problems.

2272,"I have the i7, 512GB SSD, with 16GB of RAM. I got this laptop because I needed a powerful laptop to run programs like SolidWorks and ANSYS but that was a reasonable price and small enough to bring to class. This laptop is not as small or light as the 2 in 1 ultra thin laptops but it is not big and bulky. I had an old 17.3"" laptop before this and compared to that this is tiny. But the 15.6 still has a big enough screen for multitasking with multiple windows. The batter life is great. I have not timed it but it seems to be outstanding. I have played Player Unknown Battlegrounds and it handled it great, although it ate a ton of battery. It is fast and responsive. Super sleek looking. Full keyboard is nice. I like that it has 3 USB 3.0 ports and an Ethernet. The only complaints would be the outside does smudge very easily, the fans are pretty loud, and there seems to be quite a bit of bloat ware. Seems to use up a lot of RAM when idling or web surfing.",1,0,1,2,2
2273,"(ANOTHER UPDATE: Touchscreen has died after approximately a month. Beginning the repair/exchange process. Boo.)(UPDATE to UPDATE: Powerwashing solved the disappearing mic problem. Adding the fourth star back.)(UPDATE: Unfortunately, a very annoying problem has popped up. Long/short, the mic dies when the device is slept/woken. I.e., the mic ONLY works upon initial powerup/restart. Once you sleep the device..., the mic becomes unusable for all apps. The only way to restore mic functionality is to restart the device. Reducing rating to 3 stars..., though I'm kinda ""2 stars"" upset at the moment.)It seems to me that Chromebooks are a little tricky to review. The software experience belongs entirely to Google..., and the hardware in this case, Samsung. So..., I'll split my comments between the two, pros and cons.Before I get to that..., why I bought a Chromebook: My old tablet was getting VERY long of tooth (a Xoom) AND I was wondering if there could be a laptop replacement that would make more sense from a security perspective, compared with my MBP, e.g., crossing US borders.The Software:The Chromebook ""Concept"" (aka the goog software): In many ways, particularly with regards to initial setup, this is a very nice device. Goog does a nice job of keeping simple things, simple, and complicated things..., just barely possible. The jury is still out in my mind whether I find this a satisfactory compromise compared to a ""real"" laptop. Let's just say I'm glad I only paid $400+ for this device rather than $2000+ for laptop that has a Chromebook's software imposed limitations.Functionally, it's not a bad, but it is an imperfect, replacement for a tablet..., and strangely, it's only held back in that regard by the hardware (which I'll get to). The Android support has worked well for the limited cases I've tried (Kindle Reader mostly).I'm glad I got a ""convertible"" chromebook..,, since I've found the touchscreen to generally work very well..., and seems to be well integrated with MOST (but not all) of the software.I miss support for desktop Chrome's version of ""People""..., the account support on the device really doesn't cover it.The soft keyboard (when in ""tablet"" orientation) works..., OK..., but there are quite a few cases where is doesn't integrate correctly/well with various screens/apps, i.e., it obscures the text region with focus..., so you end up typing in the blind.The way in which ""chrome://apps"" was removed seems needless..., why not just jump to the ""launcher""? This in turn creates sync complexity when managing your chromebook settings and your usual desktop settings (I use chrome://apps as the home page and new tab page on the desktop/laptop).The Hardware:Samsung has made a really nice device. Rising above all over qualities of the device..., is the screen. It's beautiful.Construction quality, for the price, is pretty dang good.Battery life is sorta ""meh"". It seems to be more on par with a smartphone, than a laptop, given comparable usage. It's not bad..., but it's not great.Speed/performance is..., adequate, but not stellar. Things like Netflix work fine, but things that aren't accelerated by specialized hardware are kinda pokey.I don't generally like devices of this small a form factor, and the Plus is no exception. It would be unfair to single it out on that basis. It will serve its purpose, but I will always prefer using my ""big"" laptop.There are two hardware limitations that I didn't think about prior to purchase, that prevent the Plus (or probably any Chromebook) from being a true tablet replacement for me: No GPS, and no ""sleep"" ability from which certain events (e.g., an alarm clock..., or skype) could wake the device.The speakers..., sigh..., they really are weak. Some improvement can be had depending on positioning of the device..., but overall..., they're not great.So..., my purchase decision was based on a compromise between possibly competing goals..., so I shouldn't be too surprised that the result was something of a compromise. Nonetheless, I think Chromebooks are here to stay..., and the Samsung Plus is a nice example.That is all!",2,4,5,4,5

I've tried looking online for help and cleared out the start menu. There was a small improvement, but not enough. Buyer beware.I'm following up with Lenovo support and they are going to perform a system reset, but cannot refund my money since it was an Amazon purchase (which is fair).

My daughter uses a Chromebook for her class so this was also a plus. Very budget friendly and we have a laptop again in the household.Update: About 2 weeks into computer , the charger went out.

This is probably a one off problem only I'm having, but it's still causing issues regardless. If you need a computer like this, go for it.

It has a front facing camera, USB Ports, micro HDMI and a charging port (not USB-c, if that's what you wanted). The trackpad isn't nice, and neither is the loading speed and stock storage, but it does manage to hold a charge pretty well and it's decent for typing and light streaming for videos.

The touchpad is pretty bad (or maybe just mine). For some reason it was such a challenge just to click and drag something. The cursor would either not click initially, or would stop working halfway through the drag. And I kept my device clean so it wasnt because it was dirty.3. The outside scratches so easily. The is the most fragile piece of tech Ive ever had as far as resistance to scratching.4. This is completely my fault but it doesnt have a regular USB port. I use a regular flash drive for my colleges computers. I guess there is a solution however, just get a Type C to Type B adapter.5. The backspace key is infuriating. Its so small compared to every other keyboard Ive ever used, I would accidentally click the ""+/="" key 90% of the time (cause thats usually where the backspace key is). I dont know, maybe you could get used to it.I know I just bashed it but of course there are Pros too..1. Beautiful screen2. Has the google play store which I loved3. Works great in tablet mode4. Samsung pen works well5. Battery Life is fantastic6. Thin and lightweightI felt kinda sad returning it because I wanted to love it. But I just had too many issues.

2343,"Editing review after 2 mos of use. This computer is both the best and worst and it is hard to really be fair since you can't get a windows computer with office for a better price. That said, it is close to impossible to use other than for watching a video. Surfing the net is next to impossible as the screen constantly resizes, the cursur will not stay where you put it--it jumps all over the place and I am constantly clicking on things I didn't intend or deleting things I didn't intend. Can't scroll with 1 hand as you need 2 hands to try and keep cursor where you want it. Impossible to do work on it other than perhaps basic typing. The small keyboard is really hard to get used to and I never did. So,it is good to have as a backup computer, if you need MS Office, but can't recommend for anyone to use for work or school.Unbelievably lightweight!Very small--like a mini laptopNo backlight keyboardSets up fast.No touchscreen!--the description says there it has one but this is an error and should be removed!Horrible track/mouse.Not a lot of memory. I have office, outlook mail, norton, 3 onedrive folders and chrome browser installed and that takes up all of the memory. No room for most of my onedrive folders or any photos or icloud or any other software programs.Keyboard takes a long time to get used to and I am constantly deleting things by mistake, including writing this review which deleted text while typing for unknown reason.The mouse trackpad is pretty bad and cursor does not stay where you put it and the screen size is constantly changing even though I haven't clicked on resize.If you copy and paste a lot or use the right click a lot, you will be very frustrated and it often takes me 5 tries to select something as the mouse doesn't stay where you put it but jumps around a lot so you think you are clicking on one thing but the mouse clicks on something else. Could be very problematic if you delete something by mistake.Bottom line, for the money, it is a good computer (so far). It has windows and office which is great for such a small machine. Watching videos is fine, surfing the web is fine but I would not use this for work or school or anything that involves a lot of typing and cutting and pasting or right clicks. Since the keyboard isn't backlit, you won't really be able to use it at night, so keep that in mind.I bought it for travel as it is so lightweight and as a backup in an emergency for my main laptop as I seem to go through laptops about every 2 years.",3,1,5,4,3

No menus would come up and it couldn't connect online.Dell customer support wasn't helpful (the free warranty only covers hardware issues, software help cost $250) , but I did a factory reset, cleaned registries, defragged, and some other things. I basically ended up fixing the computer myself and advice from a friend. Also I removed Dell Support Assist programs (the computer was working ok until I used it.

Because of this I cannot download any antivirus protection because there is no room. The battery life sucks, at a full charge I get maybe an hour of unplugged battery life. There is no internal fan to cool the system so it gets really warm. The biggest annoyance I have is after an hour or two the laptop needs to be restarted to refresh it. I was in the middle of typing when my keys stopped working, the only one that would work is the P and all that did was try to get me to print the page I was on.It is no good for streaming Amazon Prime movies/shows because they do not load all the way and buffer every 5-10 minutes.The pros are it is lightweight, the color is nice vibrant purple and that is about it.",2,4,5,4,3

From price perspective I was consideringByte Plus (Fanless Windows 10 Mini Desktop PC - Intel CherryTrail T3 Z8300 Quad-Core, 1.44 GHz (up to 1.84 GHz) 4GB RAM+32GB storage). Then I find that ASUS E200HA Portable Lightweight 11.6-inch Intel Quad-Core Laptop, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage may be a better choice since is a full notebook, light and portable. My concerns were about ability to run MS Office application on a Windows 10 platform, flash storage limitations and graphic performance becauseI will use this machine mostly in a desktop configuration using a LG wide format monitor 2560X1080. Well, when arrived, the machine was nice and small. I goth through the pains of installing MS Office at a very slow pace. Then, with Windows 10, MS Office and all other software that the machine came with I got very much to the end of the flash drive space at about 28Gb out of 32 Gb total. It was s solution for that as I tried option to compress the drive in the setting. Voila, Local Disk (C:) shows 12.6 Gb free of 28.3 Gb. Everything works flawlessly, I am so impressed and amazed with the capabilities of a $200 laptop that can do so much for so little price. Of course, other people may find limitations, however, it is a perfect choice for my special purpose of running MS Office mostly in the office with a large monitor and use it as a notebook occasionally when on the road.

I knew in advance what I should expect of the Plus when it hit the market and what to expect later down the road when the Google Play Store leaves Beta. So far I am one happy Plus owner and have no regrets whatsoever. Some folks were hoping for a backlit keyboard. I have had that feature on at least two laptops in the past and never used it. The screen on the Plus is so darn good and bright I can see the keys with no problem at all. Other folks were hoping for a faster processor. I didn't expect the power of an i3 or i5. This processor is speedier than I expected. The screen is one of the best screens with touch control that I have ever seen at this price. My son, who owns an iPad Pro with the addition of the expensive pen says he prefers the Plus for drawing. He's hard to impress. Dollar for dollar the Plus easily beats the iPad in usefulness.

When I first started it up it ran like molasses, but after looking at the task manager I found it was because it was updating every piece of software that is on it. After several hour of updating and many restarts, it now runs great. I also can't figure out how to get the free year of Office365 that the listing said was included. I have emailed the seller, but am still waiting to hear back on that. I will update once I receive a response. For what I paid, I am happy with my new laptop.Update 1: I contacted the seller, Woot, and was told to contact HP for a product key for Office365.

Screen is very nice and bright and sharp HOWEVER, if you adjust the resolution the letters become grainy. The screen comes preset at 1200x800 which is said to be (BEST) according to the setting. But for me it felt like everything was too large and I was loosing screen real estate for an already small screen. So when I adjusted the resolution to 1350 x900, the fonts and overall screen felt like a better size. But that's when you'll see imperfections in the letters. What I mean is if I were to type this: IIIIIIIIIIII I would see a few of those letters have a pixel out of place so it's not a smooth letter, if that makes sense. And I'll notice that on every few letters. I do a lot of emails so it gets annoying. I thought it was a hardware issue so thank god for great service by Amazon, got a new one in the mail within 2 days and same issue, so I think it's just an issue with the screen itself. So I found a work around and which I just reduced the ""Page Zoom"" to 90% and it's fine. But other than this issue, it's a good chromebook.

I believe this is ASUS's way of saying, they don't want to honor their warranty by providing a workable solution. I strongly recommend another brand with a better warranty service, like Dell.

2404,"2 stars is ""I don't like it"", which is true. Its cheaply made. My first one had a issue with the sound, couldn't hear from internal speaker or through headphones. With this one, the frame for the screen has peeled off from the screen so now I gotta glue it together. Another issue is it sounds like there is a wire that is loose and is being hit by the fan. Also, it often runs very hot with just a browser open or Netflix running. I have to operate a Linux partition to avoid that last issue but there are somethings I must use Windows for. This is sad because my last Asus laptop was less expensive but ran much better than this. Best thing about this thing is the long battery life and nice display, but overall it's not worth it.",3,3,3,2,4

My old travel laptop finally died and I hate spending lots of money for a travel machine when all I need are the basics. I refuse to travel with a laptop that requires ""the cloud"" to function properly. I may pull the 4GB RAM and put in an 8GB card, but that's for later.Oh, and I noticed several people complained about the track pad. After downloading all the updates, I noticed one of them was for ""track pad update."" My pad seems to work as well as my other PC after the update.",3,1,2,4,2
