0,"First time using chrome wanted windows 10 but haven't had to use my phone anymore and I no longer charge then since this helps me do everything I need at light speed! Been playing games on it non stop while streaming videos and it just blends if u multi tasking and are addicted to YouTube like myself....it's a powerful laptop for a Chromebook I've run multiple pages in HD videos streaming with very minimal lag (due to area of internet). But what I love the most is the charger which is very important as to how long ur laptop will last, not only is it super fast at charging but it is delicate and easy to plug in and it pops off as a safety mechanism I believe...either way it never overheats it charges really fast even during heavy use and it has options to really dim down the screen to save energy. It's like a tablet but you can do way more and run apps with easy... A must have if you like to entertain your family or others as the speakers on this babe are crisp and clear. It's also light and it comes with this cool bubble wrapping packaging that I've been using in between my lap and the laptop and for storage . My fav thing about this is it's taken over my use or cravings to even use a mobile or smartphone/iPhone which is only explained by how easy it is to get everything social media done on a Chromebook while I do plan to get a Dell that runs windows 10 this is really good to save ur other devices from the load social media and YouTube can out on a device built to run more complex programs. So get one for sure and forget about charging ur phone and looking like a boy who can out down his Gameboy lol jk",2,2,5,4,2
1,"Awful, cheap laptop. Entire setup is plastic and reeks of 'Made In China'. WI-FI adaptor could not find my router (3 feet away!) and the whole rig was SLOW. Sad thing is, I did my research. A LOT of misleading info on this until. Skip it.",3,1,2,4,2
2,LOVE IT! It cold boots in 2 seconds or maybe less...it is quick...graphics are great. No issues.,2,0,1,2,2
3,"Buyer beware! This was supposed to be ""like new."" While the screen was in great shape, but one of the USB ports was severely damaged and unusable and the speaker cover underneath was also damaged. It worked the first time I used it for a couple of hours then wouldn't power up the 2nd time I wanted to use it even though it was completely charged. I have returned this.",2,2,3,4,3
4,"This is a really good computer and its awesome for the price, I was a little skeptical at first but once I got it I was so happy. The memory is not much but once you buy a 128gb SD card you will be good and this is really really good for college students because it includes one year Microsoft Office!!!",3,1,5,4,3
5,Works great so far! Very light and great battery time. If you're looking for cheap fast computer then this is the one!,3,4,5,4,3
6,The person I bought this for has so far been very happy with this laptop for several months. Battery lasts a very long time and it is nice and lightweight. Perfect for what we needed.,3,2,5,4,6
7,"For what you pay, I do feel that you get your money's worth. It is a fast laptop with a lot to offer. Aesthetically, I do like how it looks, but I don't like how easily it shows fingerprints. I'm also coming from a 17"" laptop, which means that I'm having to readjust to a more confined keyboard...so for the time being I am not a huge fan of the chiclet style keys. But I'm hoping that time remedies that.",2,2,1,2,2
8,The computer operates well. But actually I asked for a grey one.,2,0,1,2,2
9,By looks its good but when I turned it on it took 2 min to start. Also it got stuck on process at 92% for almost an hour. Then I decided I made a mistake to buy,1,0,1,2,2
10,Exactly as advertised.,2,2,3,4,3
11,"Excelente producto!!. Tenia miewo, pues todos los comentarios hacia la marca y hasta del modelo no eran alentadoras. Pero muy buen producto",2,2,1,2,3
12,"I got this computer for college school work and very basic computer programming related to school. I havent used it for games yet, but I anticipate it should run well. If you buy this, let it have a day to fully install all updates. Trust me. It will take a while. There is a way to skip this process, but I dont remember the steps right now.",2,4,1,2,2
13,Love this chrome book! Lost it the day after I got it because my daughter uses it for school. Her school-given chrome book is the size and weight of a large text book.,2,4,5,4,5
14,"So far working great, very fast startup and shutdown.",2,2,3,2,2
15,It came without charger and connecting cable. Please call me and confirm when I will get these items.I can charge and test the computer only after I get theseWhen are you sending the charger and connecting cable??,2,2,1,3,2
16,Less than 6 months and the Hard Drive is going bad. Dell is sending me a box to send it to them to fix. I'm a little leery about sending it but they're doing for no cost.. I scanned the QR code and it said HD failure. I checked the description from Amazon-it's not matching what Tech is saying.. I hope Dell will bring this machine to the specifications that I bought. It only failed long after Amazon could intervene.,2,2,0,2,2
17,"Great laptop. Love it and very please with its super light weight and how well it functions and it has a great design. For simple laptop purposes it's great. I'm a student and wanted a laptop on the go that wouldn't be too heavy in my backpack. Id recommend getting a hard shell case and waterproof case which I brought both on Amazon too for extra protection. I haven't had problems with mine but keep in mind it is a very thin laptop, may be fragile.",3,1,5,4,3
18,"It might a bit too early to write a review, but I've had this for a few solid days now and overall impression is excellent.For $200, you have to forgive its shortcomings and set your expectations realistically-- but it is still impressive what you can do with a laptop computer that costs less than your average tablet. Even at $300 or $400, I'd say this is still a good buy.Like a lot of people, I have multiple computers that each serve a niche. I have: Apple MacBook Air 13"" Early-2014 (i5 with 256GB SSD), iPad 2 32GB, Samsung Note 4, Note 5, Note 3, Galaxy S3, Galaxy S4, Galaxy S5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 4S, etc. [I buy and sell used and fix phones, so I have a lot of phones: main phone now is the Note 4...], and an old home-built AMD Windows 7 Desktop (used to be gaming machine with 2 video cards).My #1 rule with laptops is that it has to be light and portable, otherwise why bother. In real estate, it's ""location, location, location"". In laptops, it's ""weight, weight, weight"". This is why my MacBook Air is my main computer. I carry that thing everywhere and battery life is great. But alas! I have a need for a Windows computer, and my old home-brewed desktop is aging (almost 10 years old now) and I figure a lightweight laptop would be nice. Since it's not my main computer, I can forgo a lot of features and storage space, so I was looking for something compact and light. I used to have a ""netbook"" from Samsung about 5 years ago which was very small with cramped keyboard and very very slow, and I wasn't impressed. So I bought this E200HA with some hesitation that it might be the same type of ""netbook"". For $200, what the hell, I said...I mainly need a Windows machine because I currently run a few Windows-only programs on my Mac via emulation and as anyone knows, emulation is very laggy and slow. So the 2 things my Windows laptop needs to run are: 1. Quickbooks, which I use for my small business accounting [their Mac version doesn't have features that their Windows version has, which I need (inventory-related features)], and 2. Proprietary BMW software for reading error codes and programming the car (INPA, EDIBAS, NC Expert, etc.). Mind you, I've been running these on my Mac for a few years now, but at painfully slow speeds. The Asus E200HA handles these software well, so it serves it purpose and therefore I am happy.But beyond that, it impressed me with its long battery life (I got about 11 hours at 80% screen brightness and moderate use), multi-task ability (4GB of RAM)-- I have 10 tabs open in Google Chrome and no lag. I don't know what some of the other reviewers saying you can't have more than 2 tabs open... YouTube videos stream fine. I have an average of about 3-4 programs open in addition to my Chrome browser and it works fine, no lag, no crashes.The computer's internal drive is 32GB SSD (solid-state drive-- no moving parts), which after the default Windows 10 64-Bit Home Edition install leaves about 17GB of free space for storage. I put in a 64GB MicroSD card in the slot for extra storage, but haven't used it yet. I'm down to 8GB free on my main SSD. A 128GB SD card also works, FYI, even though officially Asus says 64GB max. The faster USB 3 port is to the left and the slower USB 2 port is to the right. They work as intended. I hooked up my external Seagate Slim 2TB drive to the USB 3.0 port and transfers are fast as expected. The power supply looks a bit like a USB or Thunderbolt, but it's not-- it's a proprietary plug. The charger itself is very light, like a cell phone charger. External video is possible via a mini HDMI port (you need a mini-HDMI to standard-HDMI cable or adapter-- the cable is like $7 from AmazonBasics, not too bad). The trackpad is large like on a Macbook, and has gesture, but not as elegant or good as the one on my Mac, but still good for 2-finger scrolling and touch tapping. The keyboard is a bit plasticy and light and a bit smaller scale than a full-size keyboard, but not too shabby. Screen isn't anything impressive, but it gets quite bright at 100% brightness. ASUS has a guarantee on dead pixels, so that's good to know.All in all, for $200 this is quite a bargain and a great little computer. The 32GB internal storage was a concern for me, but if this isn't your main computer, it's nothing to worry about. If it is, you need to budget ~$40 for a 128GB SD Card or ~$80 for an external USB 3.0 2TB drive.",3,1,5,4,3
19,Absolutely terrific,3,2,2,4,2
20,"This is a very nice laptop with a full range of features for the selling price. The 7th Gen Intel i5 Core with 2.5Ghz is a quick enough processor for my speed needs. The 1TB HDD has more than enough capacity for my storage needs. And I find the Business Manager and Fingerprint Scanner very helpful in IT managing and security issues. Five stars for affordability vs features, speed and capacity.",2,2,1,2,2
21,"I deal a lot with Laptops, was expecting so much more from this little guy but the processor is absolutely garbage. No matter how many times you run a disc clean up, cc cleaner, etc that won't stop the processor from giving a 100 percent usage all the time. Don't even bother uninstalling apps to speed it up, I removed all the useless apps, but the Processor is always having a hard time, and lags constantly. The worst part is that every 20 minutes the screen has a quick 0.5 second crash! The touch-pad is also terrible, a wireless mouse is needed at all times.",3,2,5,4,6
22,"My daughters HP laptop started giving up the ghost and she needed a replacement fairly quickly. I have had great luck with Acer laptops in the past so I thought I would try the Acer Nitro 5.My first impression is that this laptop was a bit bigger and heavier than most of the laptops I have purchased in recent years. The casing feels to be mostly of plastic. While it is solid and sturdy feeling, it does give it a bit of a cheap feeling.My daughter mainly uses the PC for academics and light gaming. For this, the PC has performed superbly.The only thing I thought was just OK was the sound quality. I know that laptops generally do not have good sound quality, but I thought the speakers and sound in this laptop were a bit mediocre. The sound was not terrible, but it sure was not excellent either.Personally, I loved the HD screen on this PC. The light up keyboard is a nice touch I thought. Battery life runs about 5 to 6 hours with surfing and online use.After about 6 months of use, the laptop is still running like a champ. I have yet to encounter an issue.Overall, I have been very happy with this laptop. I would highly recommend this latptop for someone looking for a good laptop at a good price.",2,0,3,2,2
23,I'm still getting used to this laptop. The keyboard is a bit different than I'm used to using.Overall performance has been fine.,2,2,1,2,2
24,"I purchased this computer for simple tasks: HTML files and to play on the internet. It worked perfectly for a couple of months. Then Microsoft updated its operating system so it wanted to update on my system. No problem. But then I started getting messages that MS could not update because I needed 8 gigs of memory (remember, this is a 4 gig machine). After a while, I decided to go buy some extra gigs. Well there is the problem. The first guy that I went to said that this was not the type of machine where you add a memory, the memory is welded in. So I got a second opinion who told me that it would be easier just to buy a new computer.Then it started doing this thing where if I try to search the internet, Windows 10 is trying to update so it interrupts and I have to push ""no"" don't try to install because if I push ""yes"" then it tries to install and errors out. It has since become slow and almost unworkable because it is not up-to-date with viruses software or whatever windows is trying to install.My point to this story is that I was sold a system with an operating system that becomes inoperable within a couple of months. In if you take the initiative to try to upgrade to the point where the operating system should work, you will be told by multiple technicians that there is nothing that they can do.",2,2,5,4,6
25,I would say get then it's 800 dollars can't go wrong this is not a gaming laptop it can play games but it's not the best experience if you get it the display is utter trash so don't bother using this display and the SSD is low end so don't expect blazing fast profotmance but it will boot and run programs like you expected to. Here's the good stuff the build quality is really good and the laptop Is thing and light it has a 130w power supply and you can upgrade this by removing on screw on the back you can add ram replace the SSD and hard drive,1,0,1,2,2
26,"Pros:Quick processor and above-average graphic card8GB DDR4 memory, one stick so that increasing system memory up to16GB requires the purchase of only one more stick of memory vice having to buy two sticks of 8GB.Fingerprint biometric logon.TPM.Clear text matted screen that reduces eye-strain over long sessions of use.No pre-loaded crapware.Cons:The battery that comes with the laptop is model # A41N1421{1}, which is a beefed-up version of the reseller available A41N1421. The reseller battery A41N1421 is rated at an anemic 37Wh and 2600mAh. The A41N1421{1} original battery is rated at 48Wh and 3700mAh, which accounts for the advertised 9hr battery life. The A41N1421{1} is NOT available in the ASUS store. It is also not available anywhere else since it is an ASUS proprietary battery. So if you need an original battery replacement, you are SOL.The ADP-65GD B model power supply that ships with this notebook has a smaller proprietary plug configuration (4.5mm x P0.6 x 10mm 3/ 2 pin compact power supply system) compared to that of a conventional ADP-65GD B power supply that has a plug which is too big (5.5mm x 2.5mm) for insertion into this computer. After much testing with many other power supplies with the same power, voltage and plug dimensions, it is obvious to me that the computer is designed to be powered only with ASUS power adapters. ASUS does sell an over-expensive $80 90W multi-plug power supply witch has the proprietary 4.5mm plug. This power adapter will not give you a re-connect warning prompt. I would recommend the immediate purchase of this ASUS power adapter, since if something happens to the original power supply then the laptop would be rendered useless after the battery depletes.",2,2,1,2,2
27,This is a very nice laptop. I am really happy with my purchase.,2,2,1,2,0
28,"Disappointed to find that this product was used, box had been open and it had scuff marks on it. Understand that its a good price but it doesnt say anything in the description about the item being a return or used. BUYER BEWARE",0,2,3,2,4

31,"It was a gift, they are very happy with their Acer... I though It was a regular laptop but it was what they call a tablet??? as long as they are happy I am happy!",2,2,5,4,2
32,This computer was for my boyfriend and he is super happy about the size of the screen and the touchscreen capability. He works very well. I'd buy again.,2,2,0,2,2
33,"Insanely Slow, i was doing work on my phone faster then this. Returned it right away. Constant crashing while installing programs, and they took forever to install. Just spend a lil more for a better laptop and save your self the trouble",2,4,1,2,2
34,"Bought this lap top for my wife and purchased due to price and the size. My first ASUS and you get what you pay for.. I guess it not so much ASUS but Windows 10. It stinks. The track pad is not responsive, it jumps around. Sometimes the cursor/arrow disappears and Windows is always trying to sell you something or direct you MSN or some other Microsoft owned company by way of popups. Very annoying. My Mac Book Air blows it away, but then again, it was four times the price.",3,1,5,4,3
35,"I purchased this lap-top because I started taking class, blue is my favorite color, and it's lightweight (puuur-fect to cuddle-up in bed with).Really happy with this laptop! It's small, easy to carry around but has all the features I need. Windows 10, room for lots of pics I'm enjoying this so much I bought one for my granddaughter. Great price too. Not for extreme gaming or anything crazy. But, for typing papers surfing the web, bulding resumes. Checking email. Even watching movies. Its great. Not a huge hard drive but it is very cloud friendly.",2,2,5,4,6
36,So far so good. SSD makes startup a breeze. That alone is worth the tad bit more money. The graphics card is fine. I run games on medium graphic settings to avoid FPS drops and network lag and so far it has been smooth sailing.,2,0,1,2,2
37,"This computer is excellent for the price! I purchased this laptop for my Daughter for under $200 dollars! I bought it for her for Christmas so she could play her Sims4 on it. With the memory that is built in it, the Windows 10, and all the updates you couldn't really download a huge game like the Sims4. So I went to Staples and bought a 64 GB flash drive for $20 dollars and now she is able to download and play all kinds of games including her Sims. This computer is made for just Web browsing, Work, or School work but if you have the extra money to get a SD card or Flash Drive and you want to use it to play games, I would suggest doing these options first before getting an external hard drive. I know my Daughter loves it. I also bought the rainbow keyboard to go with it! Now she can have it to play games which I am happy because that's what I initially bought it for! You definitely can't beat the price! One happy customer! ",2,4,5,4,3
38,Bigger and better than we expected it to be.,2,2,5,4,2
39,"I absolutely love this machine. I had never owned a Chromebook before but at this price point I don't think I'd consider getting a Mac again. Beautiful design, light weight, fantastic display, decent battery and instant start up.",2,4,5,4,5
40,"Followed the instructions out of the box through all of the tedious steps for set up, expecting that things would speed up after everything was finished...wrong! This is the slowest computer that I have used since the age of dial-up internet. Take your 10 year old laptop out of the closet and dust it off...you will probably prefer it to this pathetic excuse for a computer.",2,2,1,4,2
41,"I love it. The packaging for shipment was superb. One would have thought they were shipping nitroglycerin. There were multiple boxes and protective cushioning. The laptop arrived safe and secure. Set up was easy for this tech challenged, non-geek. The system is amazingly fast, at least to me. It is quiter than I expected given the comments of other reviewers. The sound system is great for a laptop computer. I was expecting mediocre sound. I have only had it for a few weeks and am very pleased with my decision to buy it. There are so many choices out there, it can make one dizzy to finalize a decision among them. The unit is solid and feels well made. My only beef is the backlite key board. It is lite up like a Christmas tree with all the colors and from the seated viewing position the light shines from the sides of the keys rather brightly. But, no big deal for me. I do wish the Predator introduction screen with loud obnoxious noise could be eliminated. That gets old quickly.I'd recommend this system.",2,0,1,0,1

I really like the keyboard. I don't know what it is about it that's different than all the others I've ever used - keys are bigger, closer together ? I dunno, but it's very easy to type on this. It's repackaged or refurbished or something but looks brand new :o) ADDENDUM: LOVE THIS COMPUTER, WHEN IT WORKS ! I USED IT TWICE, EVERYTHING WAS FINE. SHUT IT OFF BY JUST CLOSING THE SCREEN. WHEN I TURNED IT BACK ON, IT WOULDN'T CONNECT. SAID NO WIFI DEVICES PRESENT ON COMPUTER. I REBOOTED, SCANNED, CLICKED EVERYTHING, REBOOTED MODEM ... FINALLY AFTER 2 HOURS, THE RED X ON THE WIRELESS ADAPTER OR SOMETHING WENT AWAY. WORKED A FEW MORE TIMES. I CLOSED IT AGAIN WITHOUT LOGGING OFF, TRIED TO TURN IT ON AGAIN 2 MINUTES LATER, IT WOULDN'T. THIS TIME I SPENT PROBABLY 3 HOURS CLICKING EVERYTHING I COULD, READ EBOOK ONLINE, NOTHING ...

I bought the 128GB/4GB Ram version and it works great. One of the tasks I wanted this for was for photography editing on affinity photo. I was worried that the 4gb of ram would not be enough. I figured that if it wasn't enough i could always return it. but fortunately the laptop is holding its own. However I wouldn't recommend for video editing. Other features I really like on this are the Windows Hello feature. It works insanely well. Also, the track pad is amazing! The best I've ever seen on a PC. I didn't give windows 10 S a chance so I can't review that. The first thing I did was upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. This upgrade is available until 3/30/18 so don't wait too long if you're interested in this. After that date I read it will be a $50 upgrade.",1,2,3,2,4

In the attached pictures, you can see everything it came with as well as detailed warranty information.For the past 3 months, this computer has met my expectations and more.

64,What I like about it is that having a Solid State Drive means that starts quickly and having 8GB RAM means that it operates fast even when numerous programs are running and when memory hungry programs are running. What is a minor issue is that the fairly heavy power supply plugs directly into the power point meaning that the extra weight can cause the power supply to come loose easily. It would be better to have a short cord between the plug and the power supply so that this looseness doesn't happen.,1,4,1,2,2

I hardly had anything installed in it. Bought it for my grade school kids. They uses google drive to save everything. Kids have kept complaining about how slow the laptop was, but I ignored them. A week ago, I used the laptop to go online and noticed it was slow. I tried using different sites, installed chrome, Firefox and IE. They were all showed performance. I took the laptop to a reputable service center. They diagnosed it and found out that the hard drive came with the laptop was terrible and not functioning property I had to replace the hard drive and get much smaller HD with 250GB.

86,"This review covers the i5379 etc. etc. since Amazon seems to lump reviews for different models together. Dell's unfortunate naming schemes don't help either.In case you hadn't noticed, notebook computers have gone off the deep end lately, trying to prove they're all sorts of things they're not, like tablets, or the ridiculous ""tented"" device you see in the product image. We get it, nearly every laptop has hinges that are fully articulated now. It's neither novel nor particularly useful most of the time. Let's get on with it.As a laptop, this is pretty decent. It has slim, ""ultrabook"" dimensions, although I think a proper ultrabook is at least somewhat metal/magnesium alloy in construction rather than plain plastic. The build quality of this laptop is fair, but nothing more. It feels a lot better than a $300 device, but is well behind a $1000+ device. For what Dell is asking I believe they could have tried a little harder on this front. However, it feels solid, has a nice screen, and the keyboard is tolerable. It's a decent lower-mid-range notebook. I don't like the massive bezel along the bottom of the screen (it's the one you see the upside-down ""Dell"" logo on the top of the tented version), and wish the screen format was just a little taller to actually use that real estate. The screen is otherwise quite good, though, and the touch screen is very responsive.A lot of the cost comes from the inclusion of the newest 8th-gen Core i5 processor. I have found it to be a pretty capable mobile processor, which handled my photo editing software well enough (although the 13"" screen is too small for proper editing, it works in a pinch) and is fast and smooth for loading lots of browser tabs, streaming video and other notebook things. It's not a gaming rig, of course. I do find the fresh and up-to-date Windows 10 OS boots exceptionally quickly and is responsive and easy to use.Overall this device is a curious mix of old and new. It's a mid-range Dell notebook, and as such is made with some sub-par materials and build quality. that's the old. The new is that, unfortunately, it tries to be hip by (literally) standing on its head. It's a fast and light notebook that will handle most of what you throw at it, but please for the love of all that's good, don't flip it upside down and stare that that upside-down Dell logo while you're streaming Netflix. It's a laptop, people.",1,2,3,2,4
87,"Very nice computers however, we needed these units to complete PDF Fillable forms. Chrome is the only browser option available and is not compatible.

I am still not a fan of the emmc storage and soldered RAM. That's just asking for catastrophic failure and/or obsolescence. For now, upping review to three stars.Do NOT buy... This laptop might seem to have decent reviews but it is fatally flawed. The emmc storage (hard drive) WILL fail... It's not a matter of ""if,"" but ""when.""

92,"I purchased this Chromebook for online classes primarily. I already utilized google apps and programs prior when I had an android phone. You can't download any kind of software or anything to it, which is why there's so little space on the hard drive. It's not necessary. You do get up to 100GB of storage space on your google drive for a year or two though. For school purposes, I use Office Online since I can't download the actual software to the computer, and it works pretty much just the same. I also use it for facebook, email, shopping, etc.. It can definitely be a tiny bit slow if you're trying to look at a ton of stuff at once. I had to disable the autoplay on my facebook so it doesn't play the videos automatically and slow it down. But all in all, this does exactly what I purchased it for.

No scratches or dents, and no issues with the way it runs at all.",2,2,5,4,2
93,"If you're looking for a Macbook alternative, the Surface line is the go to option. This laptop has incredible build quality and feels like a tank.

It's free.Screen quality is top notch. Colors are vibrant, and it's bright enough to see outdoors. It also gets dim enough to use at night in bed, which not all laptops can do. The keyboard is excellent, much much better than the atrocity that is the 2016+ Macbook's.

96,"Great laptop, very competent for gaming and casual use. Love the 256GB SSD + 1TB combo - startup is super fast. Passmark score of 4123 puts this in the 83rd percentile. The 16GB appears to be in a single slot, leaving room to expand (though not sure you would need more than 16GB). Outside - the laptop is not overly gamey. The lid has the ROG decal in silver - no screaming red logos on this one. the overall slim profile keeps it discrete. There are 5 USB ports, one USB-C, and a video port along with a LAN port.Keyboard is nice, with keys to directly control volume and quick launch the ROG Gaming Center app. The ROG Gaming Center is interesting. It allows you to setup upto 3 game profiles.Profiles allow you to configure the fan and display settings, as well as kill any extra running processes (antivirus etc.), so that you free up more memory for the game. You can apparently control the Game Center via an android app on a phone, but did not try that. Keyboard has RGB backlights, that you can control with ROG Aura. Some basic options are available. I have seen some laptops that can change keyboard color based on CPU temps etc., that did not seem possible with this, but did not fully explore.Battery life is okay. Its a HQ processor, not known for power efficiency. You get about 2.5 hours without gaming. Running games and putting the fan in overboost mode will bring this down.The only area that is a little irritating with this laptop is the installed bloatware. Things keep popping up trying to make you buy stuff, create accounts, upsell, etc. If you find those apps useful, you might not mind it. I found them irritating. I am especially not crazy about how intrusive McAfee can be.",2,0,1,0,2

111,"I wanted a sleek clamshell laptop in aluminum for while because all the kids on campus have them, but have always used Windows, so I was excited to see this come out. I bought it for productivity (word processing, creating slides for classes, programming, photo editing and light graphics design) and it has proved a fun machine to use because of the portability and good looks. I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro so I could use legacy software. The laptop has enough processing power for anything I've used it for and is nice and light. The keyboard is comfortable, the trackpad is smooth and accurate and the battery life is enough to get through most of the day with the performance and screen brightness jacked up.The screen is excellent and the build is solid. The fabric on the keyboard is holding up after four months' use and feels good.I'd be happy if they made the laptop a bit thicker put a bigger battery in it and upped the storage, but I feel that way about all my electronics. My only other minor gripe is that there is a lip at the front of the keyboard that doesn't seem to have a purpose (maybe to help opening the lid), and would be more comfortable if rounded. I had no intention of gaming on this, but as a surprise bonus, it streams my Xbox nicely.I used this successfully to expand the single USB 3.0 port to three and add Ethernet:Anker 3-Port USB-C to USB 3.0 Aluminum Portable Data Hub, with 10 Mpbs, 100 Mbps, 1000 Mbps, or 1 Gigabit Network Adapter with Ethernet Port, for MacBook Pro 2016, ChromeBook, XPS and More",1,2,3,2,4
112,"Are you on a mid to high end budget? Trying to find a PC that's lightweight and small, without compromising power? Do you care little for 2-1 computers or touch screens? Then this laptop is for you.The specs on this little book are phenomenal. The main selling point for this computer is its 8th Gen Intel i5-8250U processor. The processor is monstrous for this price range. Its base speed of 1.6 GHz, means that your computer will be drawing as little power as possible for low demand tasks like word processing or internet browsing. But its turbo boost up to 3.4 GHz ensures that this laptop has power for more demanding tasks.Oh, and did I mention that this processor has FOUR CORES? Yes, that's right FOUR CORES. This is unusual at this price range, as many laptops on the market around $750 tend to have dual core processors instead. This laptop's processing power rivals, and some cases exceeds others around the $1,000 mark.The PC has enough RAM at 8 GB. Sufficient for most tasks the average consumer will face, and still enough for those looking for an edge. The 256 Solid State Drive provides a reasonable amount of storage. When combined with the processor on this PC, it boots up swiftly.Its battery is more than sufficient for all day use. If you find yourself running low on power, the charger itself is extremely lightweight, and in my experience the laptop is capable of charging around 50% of its battery to near full in about an hour.All of this performance doesn't even take into consideration that this laptop is a lightweight, coming in at 2.6 pounds. As a personal opinion, being able to pick up such a light computer knowing it packs FOUR CORES of power at this price range is an unparalleled high.This laptop is absolutely stellar.",3,3,3,2,4
113,"I like this laptop. It's been dependable and easy to work on.When I first got it, the hardest parts for me were getting used to Windows 10 and the keyboard.Windows 10 turned out to be easy. There's a lot on the laptop to get one started with Windows 10 and it shows you and can go over the new operating system. It's very similar to Windows 7. Things are just in different places and set up a bit different.The keyboard took more time to get familiar with. I'd been working on a much older laptop and the keys on the older computer were raised higher and the keyboard was placed right in the middle of the laptop. On this ASUS computer, it has the number keys to the right so everything is shifted over to the left. I had a very rough time typing and locating the correct keys for a long while. But, I'm used to it now.The trackpad is smooth and easy to use. I don't have any problems with my hands pressing on it while I'm typing.The computer comes with a larger drive (1TB) but it's a slow drive. I've got another computer with an SSD and that boots up so quickly. It also access data on the computer very fast. Still, this drive seems fine. The SSD would tack on a bit more money to the cost.The display is bright and clear. I don't see any dead pixels. I do need to sit right in front of the computer to see the display well as if I move off to the side, the screen starts to darken. That's not necessarily a bad thing. If someone is sitting next to me, it makes it more difficult for them to see what I'm working on or eavesdrop of what I'm doing.The battery lasts for several hours. That's such an improvement over my last laptop. I can finally sit in the backyard and work and not have to worry about plugging into power for a long while.Oh, and this laptop stays pretty cool when on my lap. No overheating or burning my legs.There are plenty of USB ports but they are very tight to plug in to. I struggle a bit each time I need to plug or unplug something from the USB port.The indicator lights that show power or the hard drive working, are on the very front edge of the computer, to the left of the keyboard. I'm not used to the indicator lights being so hard to see. Sometimes I click on something and I wait for something to happen and wonder if I clicked or not. So, I click again. I'm getting used to looking down to see if the hard drive light is flashing to show it's working. Just a slight annoyance but it would be nice to have the indicator lights above the keyboard.This laptop has a fingerprint reader and that works great. I have one on my cell phone now, too. It's the best invention! Makes it so easy to login.",2,2,1,2,2

I have had many of refurbished cell phones in the past with no issues, I thought it would be along the lines of that. As soon as I took it out of the box, I noticed scratches all over, some looked like chips. This was for my daughter for Christmas and time was running out, so I bought her a pretty purple cover for it and hoped that would be okay. A couple of weeks ago we noticed a broken part by the USB ports, and the real kicker, we have only had this for just over 2 months, and she opened it today to the screen looking cracked from the inside and very damaged, it was fine when she was done using it last night and put it in its case and up off the floor when she went to bed. There seems to be no reasoning for this, other than I should have paid $30 more for a brand new product, even though we have only had it 2 months, I don't think there is a thing that can be done, I will just have a very upset little girl until I can afford to buy her a new one.",3,3,5,5,6

I can play HOTS with my friends with no worry of losing frames or horrible stuttering. I even ran some 3D Mark tests and the 1050ti scored WAY higher than I expected. Heat stays pretty low and I have absolutely zero complaints except for one super minor thing:The reason for the possible 4 stars - the laptop is black and shows where my hands rest.

145,"Most of the people I know don't need big fancy computers to do what we do on them, which is mostly email, web browsing, simple word processing, and streaming movies. The least expensive computer will meet your needs, and this is a good example of what works. Of course, it's not for video-gaming, or editing feature films, or storing thousands of pictures and movies, but it's an excellent value for what it does.Positive features:--It's noticeably lighter than my Inspiron 15.--It has a solid-state drive, which reboots fast (less than 45 seconds).--It runs quite cool: doesn't heat up your lap!--Long battery life. After 3 hours (mostly video) at highest screen brightness, it still had 50% charge left. Careful management would probably give ten hours of life.--No bloatware, as far as I could tell (because there isn't room for it in storage: see below.)Negatives:--Very limited disk drive file storage. It has 32 GB, but after the system, browser caches, etc., there's only about 10 GB left as accessible for the user. Of course, if you're just browsing, you don't need any file storage at all. And if you do, you can always plug a tiny drive into the USB slot.--No optical drive or Ethernet jack--Trackpad is somewhat awkward, especially for right clicks. The lower right corner isn't sensitive and the only reliable way to get a right click is with the two-finger tap, which I had almost forgotten. This may just be a quality control issue on this unit.--During setup, I was confronted with the dreaded yellow triangle (connected, but no internet access). So I called their 800 support number (the only piece of documentation in the box is a slip with this number on it). I wondered what the hold time would be. But I was immediately connected, told that a representative would be with me shortly and.... immediately hung up on. Three calls, three dial tones. A novice would be dead in the water at this point, but fortunately I had another computer that pointed me to the Windows 10 troubleshooter, which actually fixed the problem.In short, if you're looking for a machine that will meet your web browsing needs, and you want to save a few hundred bucks, and you have a least a little sophistication with computers, you can't beat the value here.",3,4,5,4,3

Also, it feels really sluggish if you're trying to do things too quickly partly because of the lack of an SSD. I feel like once I open it up and stick a ram stick and SSD in it everything should be fine and dandy.Other blemishes: The trackpad has no protruding buttons so if you're not used to that it might be a little difficult to use. It's kind of loud when you click, and it doesn't feel like it's great quality.My perspective: This is the only laptop I've ever touched that has costed more than $300 ~ however those in that range still has a nice trackpad.",2,0,1,2,2

158,"Alright so I purchased the 11.6"" not the 14"" and everything was exactly as described in the product description. I had carefully read through the reviews prior to making my purchase and have come to several conclusions. This is a great system at it's purchase price. I had decided to switch over to Windows10 Pro before receiving my product. Was pleasantly surprised how simple the process was and how quickly my new PC was up and running. The system comes with 64 GB of memory so I had also ordered a 128 GB micro SD to cover my storage needs. I am finding that half the reviews are pretty clearly folks that haven't bothered actually reading the tech specs for what they were purchasing. Very crisp images from this bitty screen, had the computer running for 5 hours and is still cool to the touch. Ran a couple low end games (visual novels and Civ3) on the system with no issues. A complaint I normally have with my laptops is the volume without headphones being inadequate for streaming television and I do not have that issue with this system.Only thing I've noticed is I have to pull and replug the headphones when starting a new episode or game. This may be an issue with my headphones though shrug.",3,1,5,4,3
159,"As an entrepreneur, this is a a great companion for getting things done. I prefer this computer for signing e-docs (because of the pen), for research (because of the screen capture and notes), for noting changes on design (pen again), showing ideas/videos/presentations (tablet or tent mode), airplane work (easy to maneuver, packs up tiny). I am completely in the Google world of calendars, wifi, phone, mail, etc. and that is part of the reason this fits in so easily.For now, most of the Android apps that I use are working. Some of them aren't ideally suited for the screen ratio and some of them just don't work correctly. I have found that to be a burden at all.",2,4,5,4,5

When I browse the internet in my free time I get closer to 12-14 hours, so high internet usage will drain your battery faster, but still, those are some amazing numbers.Display - Bright, vibrant colors. I have never had a problem reading anything, even outdoors.Keyboard and trackpad - there is a tiny bit of keyboard flex, but the keys are fine, and the trackpad is wow. The same glass trackpad as the Surface Book (read amazing)OS - I have yet to require an app outside of the Windows Store, but if you do, grab your free update to Windows 10 Pro.Graphics - can do basic gaming, but no powerhouse.Overall - great machine",0,2,3,2,4

There are a few features that we saw as it's best.-Very light and slim, makes for easy carry.-Speakers- They work very well, especially compared to the MacBook's quiet speakers.-Touch Screen is very easy to work and manage.-The key board has a nice surface and makes it easy for typing and resting hands on.-The charger cord doesn't seem to cause any fraying at the computer connection.-At this point, it runs up fast and smooth.-The APP options makes it super easy to jump to your favorite show, check email and other items.The negatives of this computer are the following:-There are no Hard/Protecting Cases made for it yet, which could be a problem especially for my household size.-The charging cord is pretty short. (I did not review to see if a longer size was available.)-The battery seems to be a good battery, however when the computer is not on battery save mode, it tends to die quick.-While on Battery save mode, the screen seems to be darker than what would be requested of our norm. (This could be a personal preference.)Overall, I highly recommend this computer. We are a MAC family and tend to steer away from other products. This computer again seems to be the closest Microsoft computer that we have touched that can compete with MacBook. We will be curious to see how long it's life lasts.",0,2,3,2,4

I do have a home surveillance program with four cameras running constantly but I had this on my last laptop too.I cannot seem to view simple YouTube videos. If I do full screen, the video stops completely. All other videos just do that circling signal looking for something. Changing websites takes forever. It just blanks out for a while.

192,"Samsung Chromebook Plus ReviewThe Galaxy Tab S2 was a decent tablet, but it felt like a downgrade from the Galaxy Tab Pro due to its lower resolution and harder to access components. It basically felt like a fatter, slightly worse version of the same tablet. After being disappointed by a little more of the same happening with the Galaxy Tab S3 coming out and hearing that Chromebooks will now incorporate Android app compatibility, I decided to take a chance and get a Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus. After using the Chromebook Plus for a fairly decent amount of time, I find it difficult to determine why anyone would want to get a Galaxy Tab S3 compared to this. This does everything that the Galaxy Tab S3 does and more, but also better. This has a better I/O dual USB Type C as opposed to 1, plus more versatile in how you use it due to it being a full-fledged computer. Both come with a stylus built in with palm rejection which is nice, and both have very high resolution displays (although the chromebook has a slightly higher resolution, this is not that much of an issue for me as both tablets can churn out 1440p video). The chromebook has a keyboard built in where you dont get that with the Galaxy Tab S3.One of the key benefits of Chromebooks compared to tablets is their full compatibility with Chrome as a browser. This is important because everything you can do on your computer with Google Chrome on a standard PC you can do on a Chromebook, where with the Galaxy Tab S3 you are stuck down with a watered down mobile version. This means that you can add extensions, use Adobe Flash without doing weird things to your Android Tablet, dual boot Linux, and more. Both can run Android apps well, although you may need to do more tinkering with the chromebook if you want to download apps outside the Play Store compared to a standard tablet. Once you do that though, you can also dual boot to things like Linux or even Windows if you so choose where the Galaxy Tab S3 is stuck with Android under most circumstances.Overall, there is really no reason to get a Galaxy Tab S3 when you could get the Chromebook Plus. Its cheaper, about as portable, and it is way more versatile than the Galaxy Tab S3. The only thing that the Galaxy Tab S3 that the Chromebook Plus does not have is the rear camera, so if you think the convenience of an average tablet camera is worth sacrificing the crapton of versatility and the cost savings of this laptop, you could go with the S3. However, for most tablet users the Chromebook Plus is a better, more cost-effective device overall.",2,4,5,4,5

Its a cute little computer and I'm happy with it for just browsing the web but don't get it for anything other that and maybe writing papers on.

211,"Purchased the 17"" GTX 1050 ti version and cracked it open to upgrade to an NVME system drive and 16Gb of Ram. As you can see, the laptop doesn't match the advertised pictures with dual fans and heatsinks. This machine, before replacing the thermal compound, was throttling constantly under load while gaming and GPU benchmarking. After replacing the thermal paste, even with Asus Gaming app running fans at 80% constantly (a number generally associated with longevity of fan bearings) I'm still seeing CPU temps of 90+ on medium load games like Warframe. Because of the layout, all of the heat is being transferred over the top of the GPU and the system is consistently warmer than I would have expected considering I was expecting a dual fan layout and this is one of the reasons I purchased the laptop.Heat is just the tip of the iceberg, though. After adding 8Gb of memory and a 250Gb NVME drive and installing Windows on the new drive is where the nightmare began. The picture in the description lists this as an FX503, the label identifies as FX73VE but dxdiag reports this as a ROG gaming laptop. So finding the right driviers was a bit of a nightmare and I still believe as of writing this that the display is either 60hz or it's not being recognized as 120hz, which is how it's advertised, again.For $800 this isn't a bad machine with about $200 and an hour of time thrown at it. Out of the box it has plenty of I/O, decent upgradability, a good processor and a decent GPU. However, with stock cooling, mechanical HDD, and 1050 ti don't expect this to perform at a 5 star level. As others have said, spend $300-400 more on something with more memory, SSD, GTX 1060, and better cooling.",2,0,1,2,1
212,"This review is for the 11"" version, not the 14"" option these reviews are bundled with now. The 11"" is like a windows version of the Mac Book Air for $200 and is is amazing at that price point if you can find it direct from Amazon. I also have the older 2GB version - I liked it so much I went ahead and bought the 4GB memory one to eliminate the ""2GB is a bit tight"" when running multiple apps issues. The cases are neatly designed and feel more valuable than the plastic they're made of. I don't abuse them so they've not gotten scratched, but should survive it anyway.The Atom CPU isn't great. The 4GB of memory isn't expandable. The 32GB non-replaceable hard drive is tight. But for $200 you shouldn't care. Buy a 64-256GB EVO microSD card slot for your bulk storage, music, games, movies, etc.I'd love for Asus to make a $499 version with a 1920x1080 touch enabled screen, 4GB and and actual m2 sata slot with a user accessible hatch on the case.

248,"The real grabber is the 13.5-inch screen resolution of 2256 X 1504;it catches yur attenion and won't let go. Your eyes will be attractedto it as if there was a magnetic pull.Then we proceed to a possible deal-breaker, the operating system.Win10S (S for Student) has security upgrades, but sprouted warts;you are limited to software packages available from MicroSoftApp store only. The corporate honchos believe this restriction willmaintain security, and to an extent, they may be correct.You will discover that Chrome will not run, while MS Edge will.Thus, you must make adjustments to Win10S; it will not accomodateall your wishes.Upgrade to Win10 Pro is an option for an additional $50, although it ispresently a free option. The Surface pen is a $99.99 extra-costaddition that was once included in earlier Surface versions. Strangely,Adobe apps can't run in Surface, so your creativity might be stuntedby this restriction.Sound reproduction is excellent, a real surprise considering Surface'sultra-thin case. Audio is really enhanced when the Surface resides ona wooden table.Another plus is the striking cosmetics of Surface - gorgeous. TheAlcantara fabric on the console is a matter of personal taste; it mightenhance your experience; it certainly won't detract from it.Surface is ideal as a portable, take anywhere laptop with functionalityof a tablet. Typical battery life is 8 hours. Wireless connectivity isautomatic, hassle-free.You are limited to a single USB3.0 port, though, which you may appreciateif you travel light. Touchpad performance has really improved the pastdecade. Tracking is precise, and clicks are positivem and no more wanderingcursors.Will Win10S become the academic operating system of choice? Theanswer is entirely dependent on cost. The Surface will set you backapproximately $1200. I cannot imagine too many school districtsbacking programs forcing parents to pony-up that much for a laptop-tablet hybrid, especially with an operating system that cannot runmany user apps. Students won't appreciate that encroachment ontheir liberties.Bottom line: Win10S has superior security features, but uers candownload and run only MicroSoft App store distros.

It has enough ports for me, the SD card sticks out when plugged in as seen in the picture.The fans turn on with moderate tasks such as video editing and photoshop, but it is not that loud to me.Keyboard is backlit and takes a little getting used to due to shorter key travel compared from my older laptop.The trackpad is just ok, it is not the best.

This is an issue that is present on almost every start up of the device on both waking from sleep and powering on from being shut off.

No surprise that a majority of the one star reviews on here are for the 2GB model.All hardware works perfectly, all inputs feel very snug and secure. The only port I haven't tried is the mini HDMI.The full size keyboard is a nice touch. The trackpad material is satisfyingly smooth and responsive. Gestures work great. It can lag a tiny bit if the computer gets bogged down but that happens rarely.No flapping or give on the hinge for the screen, and the surface of the plastic doesn't show fingerprints. The build quality and design of this machine is way beyond the price point.The speakers are very meh. They sound nice and clear but the bass response is absent.Now for the screen: I really want to emphasize that the factory settings for the display don't do it justice. Take the time to calibrate it and fine tune the HD graphics settings and you will be able to get a lot more contrast and vibrancy from the screen. Photos and videos looked much better after some adjustment.This laptop is extremely portable, and though it might not be Macbook Air level thin, it is actually lighter.

According to Consumers Reports this is much higher than other manufactures. My experience with Dell was much better for an out of warranty defect. They replaced a laptop that had a motherboard issue at no cost.My Surface 3 mini displayport does not work and it also has an issue with every USB device disconnecting then connecting again 5 times a minute when connected to the dock.

297,"I financed this laptop last month only to pay it off eighteen days later from moneys saved to purchase car tires. For several days it worked like a charm until it fell from a table onto a concrete floor with my Apple iPad Pro tablet. There were no scratches nor dents on my tablet; however, my NEW Lenovo Flex 5 took a serious beating! When facing the monitor, the left corner below the keyboard is permanently bent, and the frame has buckled on that side. The speaker still works, but it is now uncomfortable to rest my arm in that area. Yet, the product now belongs to me so I decided to continue using it to learn coding and to prepare teaching engineering to high school students this fall.Based on the published description of the laptop on Lenovo's official website, I figured it can handle The Sims 4 software and the three of its expansion kits on top of my education apps- boy was I wrong! Since loading the Sims 4, the Flex 5 takes longer to restart and to process commands. The quality went from a $650 Lenovo laptop to a $199 Dell Chromebook. A total disappointment indeed! The school district invested in a $1,500 Lenonovo laptop for my engineering courses; however, the weight is unbearable to hold in one arm after two minutes. The Flex 5 was going to work wonders due to having the capability to rotate the monitor behind the keyboard to convert it into a tablet. I just have to remind myself to remove the clear keyboard cover to prevent it from falling to the ground. The finger ID makes it convenient to log on; however, the processing speed is not what I expected. I should have waited and saved moneys to purchase another Apple Macbook Air, because my 2013 laptop fell onto concrete in the past and is still going strong without any physical damages.This purchase altered my perception of Lenovo by far, and I will consider purchasing a Samsung laptop the next go round. :-(",3,2,3,2,2
298,"****UPDATE AFTER 5 MONTHS OF USE****I still really like this laptop, but a few issues have arisen that I wanted to mention. First, the laptop shuts off at 6% battery, not when it gets down to 0%, and then once it shuts off, I have to wait about 2-3 minutes after plugging it in for it to boot up. So that's really annoying, especially if I'm in the middle of something. Also, inexplicably, the brightness keys stopped working. These are not huge issues, but little annoyances on a laptop that's still quite new.*****Original Review Follows****I have been using this laptop for about a month now and I absolutely LOVE it. Its my first Windows laptop in a long time---Ive been using Macs for quite a while---and this is really fantastic and feels like a big upgrade over my Macbook Pro.There are so many things I love about it, so Im just going to go through them. The battery life is excellent. Its very thin and light and sleek; basically its visually beautiful. I adore the touchscreen---I thought it was going to be kind of gimmicky but its super responsive and a nice feature. The speakers are amazing, and thats probably where I see the most notable difference between this computer and my Macbook---the speakers and sound is just ridiculously good. Oh, and the facial recognition for login is a neat feature.The ports are decent; I personally find the lack of an HDMI port a little annoying but that might not be an issue for most people. Thats actually the only real negative for me, so if thats not an issue for you, you might not have any negatives.I have to admit that having used a Mac for so long, I was a little worried about how I would find the Windows OS, but I found it really easy to pick up, and in just a few weeks I feel totally used to it. This computer is fast, responsive, and instinctive.I absolutely love this laptop and have no regrets for giving up my Macbook for it. Love, love, love it.",1,2,3,2,4

The Wireless card however blew me away with the speeds I am able to get.I use this laptop as my main work laptop and for gaming when I travel (which I might add is quite frequently). It has been nothing but good to me. The battery life is also amazing! I would highly suggest this to anyone in the market for a laptop >$1100 USD as the internal specs and experience cant be beat.",1,0,1,2,2

320,"This is a pretty cool laptop. Aesthetically it's really pleasing. the keyboard has red back lighting (these are the only LED's and they dont change colors) and it has some subtle but cool red accenting. One thing that did suck was that After having it about two weeks, the screen started freaking out. I have a warranty for it so I do plan on sending it back to get that fixed. If I move the screen in a certain position everything is fine. Other than the odd screen issue, I'm pretty happy with this laptop. At 15 inches, it's rather large, but the screen is a decent IPS 1080p panel. Full size keyboard, no windows precision drivers on the touchpad, so that is a little hard to use but a mouse makes that more manageable. No disk tray, 3 usb ports (one of them is a 3.0, the other two are 2.0), ethernet, usb c, and full size hdmi. Mine has the gtx 1050ti, which I would definitely recommend, It can run most new games at medium settings at around 60fps. I wouldnt recommend running this for gaming on battery power though , If youre using the graphics card the battery only lasts about an hour. Otherwise, just for web browsing or working the battery lasts about 4 hours. Its not great, but you get what you pay for. Decent build quality, a good looking laptop and decent performance. Overall I would recommend this to others",2,0,3,2,2
321,"My kids took over my other computers, so I decided to get one of my own. I enjoy the convenience of having a personal computer where all my passwords are mine, etc. This computer is sometimes a little slow, which was disappointing. But I suppose that it what I get with a dual-core. It doesn't have any other issues. I use it for email, social media, google docs and spreadsheets, calendar, YouTube, online shopping, and the like. I don't use it for gaming or music, so I can't say how it would do for that. It holds a charge very well!",2,2,5,4,2

324,"Packing was awesome, computer works good and came in perfect conditions.So far everything is working well. Will update if i notice something !",1,2,3,2,4
325,"Love it, love it, love it. A full size keyboard, with very limited memory. I solved the memory issue, by adding a SDHD card, and two USB thumb drives. I use one thumbdrive for business records, and the other for personal (photos, etc.). I have had my machine for 3 years, and it is going strong. No problems, other than the limited memory issue. You can't always add bulky software, unless you strip out a lot of other ""stuff.""However, most software solutions are online now, and it has not been an issue for me. I love this machine so much, as it is priced right for the projected life span of the technology (I usually replace my computer every 3 years or so). I have gifted this machine to three family members, who also love it. It is NOT a desktop computer, and it does not have the memory for a lot of bulky programs. But, nearly 100% of my tasks are completed on Microsoft office suite (Word, Excel), or online. Highly recommend.",2,4,5,4,3
326,"I know most people cringe when thinking about Microsoft hardware. There have been some massive failures over the years. Remember around the time of the first iphone, the Windows Phones on AT&T? What a mess. Remember trying to update them? The Surface line of tablets have actually been pretty good, but in the end most people either just want a really good tablet or a good laptop. The surface laptops have filled a nice need which is a speedy laptop that is super slim and can act like a tablet as well. As long as you get the model with at least a core i5, 8 gigs of RAM and 256 SSD, the surface laptop performs great. You can hold it with 2 or 3 fingers and fits in a tablet sleeve. I have one of these myself and we have sold about 20 of them for our employees and clients and have had very few issues so far. The finish on the laptop looks nice, but it can show some fingerprints or new to be wiped off after a lot of use. The reason I am taking off a star is because of the confusion and frustration of having these laptops ship with Windows 10 S. I won't bore you with what Windows 10 S is, suffice to say that it is a stripped down version meant for large rollouts and not suitable for most people. It's true that you can switch to Windows 10 Pro for free, but it's super confusing for people that don't know how or why they need to do that. Overall while not perfect, for the price the surface laptop is a great choice.",1,2,3,2,4

333,"This laptop has given me nothing but headaches and problems. It gives bluescreen of death ever since the first bootup. Amazon support is not helpful, the seller is nonresponsive, and acer support is garbage. Stay clear of ANY Acer product!",2,0,3,2,2
334,"This thing is tiny. It weighs so little I went to lift it up thinking it would be as heavy as my old one and it nearly flew out of my hands because it's so light. It's powerful, and connects to my external drives easily.",3,3,3,2,4
335,"For the price I think it's one of the more powerful laptop you can buy. The A12 9720 is definitely comparable to the Intel i5 in terms of processing power. However, the AMD Radeon R7 built into this laptop beats all i5 laptops out there. The R7 is a very capable graphics chip. Able to handle pretty high resolution graphics without lagging and slowing down the computer. Once the R7 gets updated to the latest drivers, I noticed I am able to set my screen resolution to 1080 instead of the standard 768. I am not a gamer but some reviewers here have tested it on some pretty high resolution intensive games and are happy about it. That's really good testimony to the R7. With 8 Gb of RAM it is more than capable of handling multiple open windows and browser tabs. A terabyte of disk storage is more than enough to save all your data. The entire laptop is plastic, for the price range I can't complain. The battery is non-removable. It is also very slim. Comes with a USB-C which is great. It allows charging of devices without even turning on your laptop. Overall construction of the laptop is OK.What I don't like about it - which is why I removed a star - the fan is extremely noisy. The disk is also noisy. I also prefer laptops to have removable batteries. And to all potential buyers ... updating the laptop to Windows 10 build 1709 takes a while. So this has nothing to do with Lenovo. Be patient while it updates; it's necessary.Overall, if you do not want to spend more than $400 on a reasonably fast and powerful laptop, anything with the AMD A12 9720 with the Radeon R7 GPU is a great buy at $300+. This Lenovo definitely fits the bill.",1,4,1,3,2

341,"I'm a software engineer. I take excellent care of my computers; shut them down when not in use; keep them very clean. No food or drink near them. I have laptops from 10+ years ago that still work (yes, I actually still use them). This Dell is terrible.- Purchased June 2017.- Broke December 2017. Would not power on. Sent in to Dell for repairs; they said it had a defective motherboard board. Fixed it under warranty.- Broke again April 2018. Same problem as before.Now I'm forced to buy an extended warranty because I have a laptop that breaks every 5 months. I guess that's one way to many money... Thanks, Dell.The good:Very fast (when it actually turns on). Nice graphics.The bad:The keyboard is garbage. I thought it would just need to be broken in. However, even after 10 months, some keys are still very stiff. If you don't push the keys just right, it won't register. Not good for fast pace gaming. For example, trying to push W to move forward and nothing happens...",1,0,3,2,2
342,Useless thing. Doesnt have a Word or Excel. Everything I did on the computer gets deleted next morning. Memory of the laptopis tiny. Basically the only one thing you can use this laptop for is just for watching YouTube. So actually to me its not a real normal laptop. I can do more things with my iPhone than on this computer. Thats why the price is so cheap probably... But free cheese is only in a mousetrap. So its better to pay $100 more but have a good usefull thing.,2,2,5,4,3

Using primarily as an HTML-coding, writing, and internet research computer, with occasional light photo editing. Xubuntu 17.10 (ver 4.13 of kernel) loaded flawlessly with no Wifi, trackpad, or touchscreen issues (a Lenovo I tried had Wifi problems with Xubuntu 16.04, and trackpad problems with Xubuntu 17.10, touchscreen not evaluated). i3 CPU is sufficient for anticipated use. 4 stars for working well with Xubuntu Linux and including 1TB drive and 8GB RAM, 1 star deducted for cheap feeling ""integrated"" trackpad buttons (I prefer dedicated buttons, rather than corners that depress to click). Win10 took awhile to set up (typical I'd say for Windows), and takes longer to boot than Linux, but considering it is primarily used for Linux, no stars deducted for it.",2,2,1,2,2

350,"For the price, I was really pleasantly surprised by this computer. It looks good, runs well, has good battery life, keyboard is easy to use and responsive, setup was a breeze. This is a great first computer for a high school or college student, or for someone who does most of their work online ""in the cloud."" It doesn't have a ton of RAM or hard drive space, so you can't install and run very complicated programs on this. But, if most of what you use a computer for is Facebook or online games or Google documents, you can't get much better than this.That having been said, I want to reiterate that this is an inexpensive entry level laptop. So, any bad points to the computer are because it is inexpensively made. The screen is good, but not great, and I wouldn't expect to have HD clarity when watching movies. It does come with a front facing camera, but the camera picture is really not good. I found it to be very blurry and grainy. If all you are doing is using Skype to talk to your friends or whatever, the camera is fine.Overall though, it's a solid computer for the price point.",3,4,5,4,3

352,"My background: I'm a college student, so I use it for schoolwork and games sometimes. I never had a gaming laptop before.I've had it for a month now; I got it for $200 off, which is a great deal, though I would not recommend buying it for full price; from what I read, there are better laptops for the price range. It has a lot of useful features, like the cooling boost and shift. I'm not a fan of the default colors on the monitor; it looks too white, but I turned up the contrast so it looks better. The audio on the laptop isn't too good either, but I usually use headphones so it evens out. The speakers are also closest towards you on the bottom, though the laptop slants down anyways so the design seems pointless.As for gaming, I mostly use it to play League of Legends, which I can run at max settings and have it perform perfectly, which is great! Fortnite is the other demanding game I play, which runs at 75% max settings; still works and looks great. Everything else is on Steam and isn't that demanding, like Age of Empires 2.The laptop feels pretty sturdy for transportation, which is good when I take it to the library to study. The touchpad is slightly to the left, so sometimes my left hand will drag the cursor down the screen a bit or jump to a different part of a paragraph, which can be annoying while writing a paper. It has a fast startup time. The screen itself reduces glares a lot and makes it easy to see in bright areas; I've never had to turn the brightness above 30%Overall I'm satisfied with it.",2,0,1,2,2

The touchscreen and pen support are wonderful, even though the pen lags (it isn't for artists, otherwise gets the job done well enough).Doesn't get a full 5 because the lid is difficult to open (the magnet/hinge is too string, probably so it won't shake much when touching the screen), and Windows 10 is still very buggy.

409,"My grown daughter pressured me into this.. I waited forever for it to come available (pre-ordered it, then there was a long delay.) It is much smaller than I expected, not widescreen, feels awkward after using a widescreen Samsung Chromebook for years. The only advantage to its narrower squarer size is yahoo can't fit as many ads in your yahoo mail. hahaI have used it to watch a movie, the picture was excellent, but again, not widescreen, that's really hard to get used to.. and there isn't enough wrist support, so I can see problems down the road. The volume is also seriously deficient, you can barely hear it at all. I've ordered an expensive set of headphones, that was not necessary with my older Samsung Chromebooks. It also looks like I'll have to order a Chromecast Ultra if I want to view the screen on my television. WAY more expense than I ever planned on... and very disappointing.

With its GTX 1060 discrete GPU, it does that job just fine, but ONLY WHEN PLUGGED IN.This laptop is completely unusable for 3D gaming while on battery. Something is throttling GPU speed to be REALLY SLOW when you don't have AC power. For one scene (part of the Heaven benchmark on Steam), I get 70 fps on AC and only 12 fps on battery.I worked with both Dell and NVIDIA online support to find and disable all the power-saving settings I could, and nothing made a difference. Maybe there is an additional setting somewhere that the support people could not find, I don't know. But nothing we did fixed the slow GPU speed while on battery.",1,0,5,2,2

It tends to heat up, so I recommend that a fan be purchased to accompany it. The sound quality is excellent. Sound effects are very clear and less ""tinny"" than on our non-gaming laptops. The blue lights on the keyboard are fun too. My family has not had a Dell before, and we are pleased with the performance of this model.",1,0,3,2,2

For 800 bucks it runs almost every game you'd want to play on high quality and 60fps (games that aren't extremely graphics intensive). BUT, a lot of people complain that the computer is slow (and so did I at first). It turns out that you just need to disable a lot of the startup bloatware and useless Microsoft services. Once you do, it'll run a lot faster. Just make sure that you have it plugged in to charge when gaming or else you'll experience frame drops and quality decrease.

440,"Arrived today (2-21-18)....not impressed by how cheap the feel of this laptop is, I can get over that. I plugged in the charger, powered up/configured account information....noticed response time was a bit sluggish but I continued to install email/dropbox and windows updates, walked away from this laptop for a few hours came back and my dropbox was transfering via (LAN @ 1Gb) at 1 Gig per hour, that's nuts (way to slow)...noticed that the hard drive activity was at 100% did the usual stopping of services like windows search, Background Intel and Skype uninstall, but still this 100% hard drive activity won't go away, even after a reboot the computer is sluggish even at the login screen, after a few hours of troubleshooting I decided to reset the OS back to factory and see what that does. As you can see in the pictureI did the reset, and that seemed to fix the 100% hard drive activity, now a physical issue and unfortunately there is nothing that can be done, a 2TB-2.5inch HDD spins at 5400 rpm and that really slows up the performance of this machine the RAM and CPU are skating along and the HDD is at 100% and overheating, installing a SSD drive would solve this issue but storage is still expensive, a 250Gb SSD is under $100, and good luck taking this computer apart also, you can't add a second physical drive in this as another reviewer stated it did, I saw a video from HP on the previous model to this and the insides of this are packed tight. so I stopped removing the back cover I didn't have the right pry tool to seperate the case and I really didn't want pry marks all over thisAnother issue, windows updates is taking forever.....it's doing the feature update and the computer is at 0% updated after 45 mins and yes there is a HDD light/indicator on this....of course it's on the side of the unit so you have to look around the monitor to see it and it's lit and chugging away thanks to the 5400 rpm HDD in a fast machine (it took 4 1/2 hours to do this win10 features update)I will give this laptop a few days and make my judgement call, but I am going to start the paperwork for the return on this unit, I'm not an optimist with this computer but, I will give it a chanceThe Pro's: Excellent CPU, the benchmarks on this is what made me decide to purchase it, also 12Gb RAMThe Con's: read everything above the Pro'sEven with the reset OS and the physical limitations of the HDD This machine should be faster than it is, I have a few 5400 rpm hard drives in much older computers than this and they are okay in speed, a lot faster than this. I am now thinking there is something physically wrong with the hardware or hard drive another reviewer stated he had the same issues and seems now so do I, time to do another OS reset and back to Amazon it goes (after a few days), and no I will not recommend this to a friend or enemy and I will not purchase this again. Back to Acer or Toshiba no more HP's great name, crap laptopUpdate 2-23-18: I am trying really hard to like this computer, I uninstalled Crapavee AntiSpeed What they call Anti-Virus and other things that I don't need but I like Movie Maker and you can still download it and when I did called ""Microsoft Essentials 2012"" it took 10 minutes to install. when this laptop updated to the latest win10 feature it took 4 and 1/2 hours, don't think of multi-tasking on this machine just watch the task manager hard drive activity, it will always zoom to 100% while the CPU and RAM are surfing along with no effort, maybe I'm spoiled by the SSD drives, but watching the task manager tells me the brick wall on this laptop is the 5400 rpm hard drive.Final Update: I purchased a Samsung 850 Evo 250G SSD Drive, removed the sluggish 5400 HDD, installed the Samsung SSD (see pic) downloaded from Microsoft Win 10 ISO burned to DVD and USB Installed OS in 15 minutes...(wow) Installed updates (super fast) went to activation and it was already activated through my Microsoft account but it was the Win10 Home edition, I have Win7 Pro so I added my product key and now this HP-SSD Upgrade Laptop has Win10 Pro. This laptop is now super fast (it should be) with the $96 SSD drive and I will purchase a USB3 external drive case for the factory 2TB HDDand use it for my 1TB Dropbox as well as data. I now have a great computer for $627.64 ...the cover isn't really that hard to remove just to let you know under the rubber feet there is a screw below each pad.if you are willing to work with it and changing out the HDD for a SSD this computer is well worth the cost of $627.64and I did a benchmark test and with the SSD drive this computer is highly ratedLast Thoughts: I spent too much time to get this laptop to this level (I'm typing this update on it) but it is the fastest computer you can get for the price, I have a 8 year old desktop and this laptop is taking its place and after working on this laptop for a few days then going to my desktop there is no comparison, this laptop is a keeper. I use Photoshop and this laptop processes fast ..... it's good to see the RAM, CPU and SDD are all on the same workload",3,2,0,2,2
441,"This laptop has a feel of very high quality. Also, the parts have good quality for the price. My wife uses it for studying, and leaves everything open.

Samsung made the screen perfect.Even its hi res screen, I don!t need zoom .I can read texts very comfortable.Performance is very well balanced. I installed bunch of apps. No lagging. No heat issue. Battery is ok. I use heavily (youtube, netflix, blogging,surfing) 6.5 hours later it says %10 remains :)I always like to use samsung tablets but when I need to surf in internet I needed chromebook or laptops.

445,"I have noticed how slow the laptop may seem to be, but consider windows 10 is a big OS compared to the earlier versions. Also Hard Drives is slower than Solid State Drives. But is this bad? Not necessarily. You have enough power to game and do light video editing. This is not a workstation gaming laptop costing over $2,000. Tech guys has always been iffy on AMD APUs but after I figure out how to keep software up-to-date, it works wonderful. For me I love this purchase and it works for me. Eventually I might add in an ssd and expand to 16 gb of ram but this is enough for me.So my final verdict is for someone on a budget, this is perfect for light gaming and video editing. For better than this, either spend more for upgrades of this laptop, or go for something dedicated to 24/7 heavy use. Thank you Lenovo and AMD. I am impressed for what I got.Update November 29, 2017: My laptop froze and I know why. Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge was acting wonky. So a heads up. Download current AMD software and CCleaner or a better Cleaner. After CCleaner removes temp files from Microsoft Edge, one day of browsing internet and 1 gigabyte of hard drive space was Microsoft Edge ONLY. So lesson learned, always clean your PC the moment it gets slow. Looking at it, Microsoft Edge and Windows 10 is POWER HUNGRY. I hope Windows 10 improves better in the near future.",1,4,1,3,2
446,Amazing price for and amazing gift,3,4,5,4,3
447,"I had really high hopes for this Chromebook  after all I was one of the early testers of Chrome OS a few years ago and pitched it as the ultimate alternative to OS X or Windows.In the early days Chromebooks cost less than comparable Windows units and about a fifth of what a true Apple laptop would set you back.While the latter example holds true (if you can get a new MacBook Air for around $450 its probably stolen) the former isnt holding up much. Just about anybody can get a baseline Windows laptop for around the same price this Samsung costs.True, you might not get the touch screen or the really high resolution, but you will get the same amount of RAM and, at the very least, the same SSD space (32GB in base versions, including Windows). Of course, Windows or OS X units do not come with the Android Play Store.And lets not forget the case  aluminum instead of plastic is a great plus.But the positives end there. The cons far outweigh anything else, to wit:* No way to upgrade RAM or SSD. Both are soldered to the motherboard.* To say the Play Store is a bit buggy is being generous. I downloaded several of my Android standards and those that operated did so with such lag as to be useless. WPS Office comes to mind. I opened a simple .docx 10 page narrative (no tables, and no special whirligigs) only to have it sputter and stall at nearly every turn. Half the time I was typing faster than the characters were showing up on the screen. Meanwhile my Linux box and LibreOffice take documents ten times as long without a hiccup.Oh, and forget anything designed for the smaller screens of tablets or phones. Those just bounce around looking for a place to roost on your larger screen.* Use Google Docs instead, you say? I tried both online and offline versions and found both to have serious lag issues. 4GB DDR3 RAM and there are still lag issues?* The case may be aluminum but it sure doesnt look or feel like it. Until a disbelieving friend thumped it she thought it was just more colored plastic.* Feel like actually seeing your screen? Go ahead and crank up that brightness and just watch the battery die in about 4 to 5 hours. My 7 year old Lenovo converted from Windows to Linux bests that by 2 to 3 hours (yes, I did replace the battery in my Lenovo but which the same type it came with).* As much as Google may state there is plenty to be done with this unit even if youre offline, I just havent found this to be true. Sure, you can piddle with Google Docs offline but dont count on anything being saved until you sign online the next time around.There is one sterling compliment I must pay though  the onboard pen for note taking and artistic endeavors is genius. It does very well with one minor exception  my handwriting still stinks even if I make it orange or fuchsia.Sorry, but I just cant recommend this unit for the price-point. If you must go Chromebook, pick a less expensive variation.",2,4,5,4,5
448,"I wanted to like it. It has much going for it. It is small, portable, cheap and easy. Alas, you get what you paid for. It has minuscule memory. I got an SD card for it to boost its memory, and that helps with storage of data and apps. However, there is insufficient memory to download and install Windows Updates. There are a number of workarounds posted on the web, but so far I haven't been able to get any of them to work for me. Finally I just had to turn off the Automatic Windows Update so I could get any work done at all. I am shocked and saddened that HP and Microsoft haven't negotiated a fix for this yet. I still use it and I still like it, but not being able to load Windows Updates is a major issue, and had I known about it before I bought it, I wouldn't have bought it.",2,4,5,4,3

So when I got my 2nd laptop I plugged in my Win10 bootable flashdrive and performed a clean installing of Windows and then I installed all updates, BIOs, and drivers. I then installed my own antivirus software and that immediately fixed my HDD staying maxed out because it was due to Windows Defender. My only dislikes is that it uses Seagate HDD and Samsung memory chip. Every Seagate HDD that I've owned which is a lot has all failed and I hate all Samsung products because all have failed for me in laptops, tv's, and phones. Western Digital HDD is what I like and never had one fail. My other dislike is that I have to remove the complete back panel to gain access to the HDD or memory. I like it better when it has a small quick access panel for this. I only recommend this laptop to Tech's and not the average users due to Windows 10 problems.",1,4,1,3,2

I'm able to have a bunch of tabs open in Chrome with no noticeable slowdown. I've even used it to edit 24-megapixel photos in GIMP while traveling. It's around 4-5 times slower than my screaming fast i7 desktop computer when performing CPU-intensive photo manipulation functions, but again, this laptop is $200. It's also able to run emulators up to the PlayStation 1 era with no issues.It's plastic painted to look like metal (I guess that's just the style these days) but it feels well built -- less squishy than my previous cheap laptop. Looks more silver than gold in my opinion, and that's a good thing. It looks professional. I wouldn't feel self-conscious taking notes on this thing at a conference, unlike other whimsically colored laptops at this price point marketed towards college students. Some people may be able to rock the vivid purple laptop look, but I am sadly not one of them. The chiclet style keyboard is great too.I'm saving the best for last: it has 10+ hours of battery life even with moderate-to-heavy use. It has lasted entire flights across the country on half a charge. I've never owned a laptop that could do that before.",3,1,5,4,3

481,"I bought this computer a few months ago, and I've had many problems with it. First thing is that the fan turns on way to frequently, even when I'm browsing the internet; to top it off, it's very loud. Secondly, the display is pretty bad. Don't even talk about the frame rate. Also, physically, the parts are so brittle, I dropped it on my couch and half of the plastic things in front of the fan fell off. I had to spend a lot of money repairing that. Overall, if you are looking for a new computer, I don't recommend this one.",1,0,1,2,2
482,"I love this laptop so much!! Considering the fact that I was using a hp probook 4540s, this is quite the upgrade for me.The laptop has a very good design and finishing to it. The red backlit keyboard is so cool and loving and it gives a hint on the gaming side of it.The keyboard is sturdy and sweet to type on. The speakers are great also.Then, the powerhouse of the laptop is the GTX 1060 MAX-Q design. I have tested it so far with Rise of the tomb raider, FIFA 18, Ghost Recon wildlands, far cry 3 and they all ran at 60 fps and above on high settings. Although the fans get a bit loud when playing games but that shouldn't faze you if you're really into the game or better still, get a pair of headset.The fingerprint reader is a sweet and fast addition to the laptop incorporated in the power button.In summary, the laptop is a really good one for the price tag and I'm loving every single bit of it",1,0,5,2,2

Companies say they have no control whether or not their machines work well with Windows, which they are designed to do! They seem to pass the buck to Microsoft, saying they have no control over how much space an operating system takes up. I know the trend is to make Windows hardware that is lightweight, but 64 GB should be the bare minimum of installed storage. This approach only works on chrome books.

493,"I just bought the Surface laptop in Cobalt, I wanted the Burgundy but it was out of stock. I am a 60 year old professional who is not technologically sophisticated. I have a 17"" HP laptop at home that I love, but I desperately needed something light and easy to use. I travel quite a bit and I wanted to bring my laptop to work to take notes. My 17"" HP was too heavy. I tried out the Surface Pro and it is adorable but screen is too small. The HP two in ones were great and I actually bought one but turned out to be too heavy for regular back and forth to office so I returned it for this laptop. This laptop is just right, very light but I can work with the screen size just fine. I absolutely love the touch screen, and the material the keyboard is made from. It's really comfortable. The touchpad with cursor is very easy to use, though I still prefer a mouse. I'll get the pen soon.The Windows 10S that it comes with is annoying but the upgrade to regular Windows wasn't too difficult. The number of USB ports is small for all the things I like to attach, but no worries, I simply bought a USB attachment in Best Buy that has 4 ports in it for my mouse, printer, and flashdrives. I got a year subscription for Word, Excel, and Power Point but this suite does not come with Outlook which is separate. Best Buy transferred all my documents easily, but transferring everything I had saved in Outlook was quite difficult and time consuming, and it wasn't perfect but it is up and running now. I am still practicing using the new Outlook. All in all, I just love the size and weight of this laptop!.",0,2,3,2,4

499,"Graphics are awesome. However, the performance isn't always great. There are frequent updates that can take an hour to finish. When I've set the computer to update and shut down, it's gone on standby while updating multiple times. This means that the next time I want to use the computer, I try to turn it back on and it hasn't finished updating yet, so I can't use it right away. I'm trying to start working from home, so I need a computer that's more reliable than that.Loud fan, as others have commented. The product description when I bought it said that this has a ""quiet fan,"" which isn't true. Also, there have been times when the computer has struggled to perform when all I had open were some Chrome tabs and a Steam game. I didn't expect my game to have poor graphics and start lagging under those circumstances. Seems weird for something that claims to ""smoothly run your games and photo- and video-editing applications, as well as multiple programs and browser tabs all at once.""Honestly, I wish I hadn't spent so much money on this.

I've even had computer whizzes look at it and it would cost as much to fix as the laptop itself so I pretty much have to buy a new one. Not worth it to me, maybe I'm crazy but i think computers should last more than a couple years. I also had various issues from the get go with turning it on because the power button is flimsy and sometimes it would take hours just to restart. A few times it would not register that the keyboard was hooked in either making it a huge pain to type and impossible to use the mouse.",3,1,5,4,3

502,"Very slow, partially due to not having Windows configured at all. Waste of time 5400 HDD, don't even bother. Did not recognize GSkill DRAM of proper spec. DDR3L DRAM when the chipset and CPU clearly would support DDR4. BIOS is terrible and almost non-existent. Fitted with an NVMe m.2 socket but advised that only SATA is supported. Screen is marginally acceptable but bad. The viewing angle is so poor you can't even get a same-tint background all the way across the screen. I sent it back and won't be buying another ACER. Support material is TERRIBLE and printed in text so small you need a microscope. The 8th Gen i3 is adequate, but theentire system is lacking. Misc detail - The Mobo is a KBL Ironman_SK and the DRAM timing as delivered is 11-11-11-28. Perhaps Acer will fix this in the next iteration. Very glad I didn't spend more to get the i5 with the screen the way it is. ~~",2,2,1,3,2
503,"SUMMARYThe E 15 is a fast computer with plenty of ports and great battery life, but the washed out screen holds it back.DESIGNWith a bevy of ports including VGA and a DVD drive, plus its heavy weight, the E 15 screams ""work computer!"" This isn't a bad thing, because it also feels substantial, including the monitor hinge. Many laptops in this price range feel like they need to be babied to survive long. There is a physical Ethernet port, an HDMI port, three USB 3.0 ports, and up to date 802.11ac WiFi. One nice touch is that the matte plastic has that brushed look, giving it a bit more traction and style. More importantly, and unlike many modern laptops, it is easy to service or upgrade.PERFORMANCEThe 8th gen Core i3 2.2 Ghz CPU and 6 GB memory combine to give swift performance for most common tasks like word processing, web browsing in many tabs, and streaming video. One shocking thing to me is how well it handled running its own 1080p screen, a second 1080p screen over USB 3.0, and a third 2560x1440 screen all at once without issue. I was running multiple HD video streams and web browsing at the time on different screens. My previous laptop that cost much more and had a dedicated GPU dropped a lot of frames in this configuration.I only notice the weaker CPU compared to my more expensive laptop with CPU intensive or heavy 3D tasks. If you are running those, including things like gaming beyond the basics or rendering video, this may not be the right choice. With that said, at this price, there is no great solution.I see another review talking about how slow the computer is, which makes me wonder if Windows was still installing updates. Any new computer is going to be slow while all that happens in the background. The network is being pushed, the hard drive is being run heavily, and the CPU is periodically busy. The only thing noticeably slow is startup. An SSD upgrade would speed things up substantially.SOFTWAREWhile I have to use Mac OS and Linux for work, Windows 10 is my favorite OS. It is flexible and easy to work with, with the most support for hardware and usually no headaches installing new devices. This version of Windows 10 is almost clean, but includes a few things that I would delete. Namely, Norton Antivirus, which can cause issues and slowdown. It is easy to delete and Windows 10 has an antivirus built in.DISPLAYIt is obvious where costs were cut to get the low price when you see the monitor in action. It has a large bezel, which is not such a big deal. However, the colors are washed out and even more washed out when not looking directly at it. It is one of the worst screens I have seen in a long time, and the main reason for dropping my score. It is passable, but I would personally spend a little more for a screen with better blacks and sharper details if I was going to do a lot of writing on it. While people rarely use laptops outside, the screen is also not bright enough for that. As someone who usually cranks down the brightness to save my eyes, that aspect is fine with me.If you are going to be docking it and using standalone monitors, it supports higher resolutions well.INTERFACEThere is no touch screen, which I surprisingly miss because touch controls are so good in Windows 10. But, they aren't critical. The keyboard has nice travel and a proper full layout. The trackpad isn't as responsive as a high end laptop and the clicks aren't as snappy, but it works properly and I haven't had to fight with it.BATTERYWow, the long battery life is so much better than my previous laptop, whichcould last through a movie and then be done for. This is likely due to the newest Intel CPUs being built for low power consumption in combination with Acer's lack of concern over a big heavy battery. The result is that, as long as I charge it at night, battery life just isn't a concern. There is even a charging port for phones or tablets that is functional with the laptop off, making this a replacement for USB batteries.The charging itself could be improved, with a relatively large power brick. I was hoping they allowed charging over USB, but I don't think that is available. I could be missing how to do it.EDIT: I forgot to mention the bright blue light that stays on when it is charging and shut down. It is very annoying to have it in my bedroom. A bit of electrical tape fixes it, but I wish it wasn't there to begin with.",2,2,1,3,2

507,"Its decent. Worth the money. Could have had a better quality for the price but its adequate. Its a bit slow/glitchy when opening certain apps or windows which can be annoying but fast enough to do what i need it to with no major problems. I like the look as a whole and like the feel of the keyboard for the price. Dont like the feel of the mousepad or the mousepads left and right click. They suck. But i use a seperate mouse so no biggy. Its relatively quiet but not all the time. Battery life isnt as great as expected but its good enough for the price i suppose. Its lightwieght for its size so thats good. I like most everything about it but i dont love it. Id change a few things and add about 50 bucks to the price but thats just a personal preference/opinion. As far a laptops go, its a good computer for a price that wont break you. It does what i need it to do, and then some, with minor annoyances here and there but not to the point of it being something that would cause me to not recommend it. If you can find better for the same price or maybe just a little pricier, go for it. Im just glad to have a modern, working pc. Thanks.",2,1,1,2,2

512,"This is not a bad machine at all, the only thing that kept it from getting five stars is that there were a couple of sloppy errors made when the machine was refurbished. Screws missing, parts replaced with different colors than the rest of the machine, cosmetic things like that. It's a refurb, so these kind of things are not unusual, but since this was allegedly a FACTORY refurb, they just shouldn't have happened.This must have been one of those machines the home shopping networks devote an hour to selling because it was offered in every color of the rainbow and has a lot of features it doesn't really need. Be that as it may, at its core it's a fine machine, plenty of storage, decent (although non-expandable) RAM, enough ports, and only a minimum amount of HP bloatware. The display is good, 17 inches of good color and no bad pixels. keyboard is comfortable to use, and touchpad is responsive without being overly sensitive.A really good machine for the price, and I don't mind buying factory rehabs for this kind of a device.

516,"I ordered my model from Best Buy, as I will start university and wanted a reliable, convenient, and dependable laptop for college years.And I love this thing, it's light, powerful, and with the large update and upgrade to Windows 10 Pro I haven't had a problem with this computer. I purchased the Surface Dock for this which truly transforms it to a desktop computer you can rely on, so this will come in handy when I come to work at home and could use the extra ports and power.The battery is great however the 14 hours part is misleading! After lightly browsing Fire Fox, upgrading to Windows 10 Pro, and setting the option to best battery life, low brightness, etc. The battery only lasted about 5 hours before getting to 30%. I notice depending on what you are doing, battery performance will vary greatly, form streaming, running programs, having multiple browsers up, etc. But the battery still is great.This laptop has an excellent design, this is by far the best touch screen I've used on any computer, which will come handy if I ever need to draw quick notes in the future.CONS:-Other colors not available for the more powerful models-Screen wobbles when you touch the screen, so if that will bother you look to getting the Surface Pro-Price. It's rather common sense to not get 4 GB in 2017 if you're spending 1000+ on a laptop, so be prepared to cough up a to of cash for this. I myself spent 1500+ dollars at Best Buy with a 10% discount... I am not rich, I had to save money all summer, but it was worth it.-You won't be able to upgrade parts on this laptop or do home repairs, so MAKE SURE you get the specs that will last through four years (I assume most getting this laptop are fellow college students such as myself) and consider you may one day have to send this in for repairs. However the superior build quality makes me feel comfortable that the only way this could break is if it were my fault or I was really unlucky/careless.-No USB-C-Mini-USB, but no HDMI or USB-c...? Really Microsoft? I've always loved and used your products but come on. If you're gonna make us use all the extra dongles, at least include them!-One USB slot, NO memory card slots!Other than that, make sure to watch reviews from various trusted YouTube Channels such as from Dave Lee and Linus Tech Tips to make sure this is the Laptop you need and want!",1,2,3,2,4

523,"It is built very flimsy.The evident build quality is obviously poor.Like other reviewers noted, it comes loaded with all kinds of bloatware, and with an old version of Windows 10.It took about a day of downloading Windows 10 updates before I was even allowed to see the system and hard drive, in order to verify it was the computer I ordered. Then there was another day of cleaning out the Dellware. BTW, forget it if you do not connect to the internet by cable. The WiFi Windows 10 update did not work at all.I suppose if the cost of the computer is cheaper due to the bloatware, you could make arguments that it is OK. But if you want to just buy a computer and use it right away, don't get this thing.For instance, it comes with McAfee antivirus. It only took two days before I was getting pop ups for an expensive monthly subscription to McAfee, or ""be unprotected"". It took me quite a while to figure out how to remove McAfee and start up the free Windows Defender.Even after a lot of effort on my part, the computer is still infected with Dell software, and I expect I will never quite delete all of it. Little windows keep popping up asking me how I feel about Dell service, for instance. It is very difficult to know which program from Dell is needed for something essential like mouse support, and which one is basically Dell spyware.The hardware side of things is no picnic.The thing re-boots itself once or twice a day for no apparent reason, and then starts up YouTube and plays the last YouTube video I have watched. So in the middle of the night YouTube starts playing, and I have to unlock the screen in order to turn it off.After it self re-boots the touch screen feature often will not function. A re-boot will not bring back the touch screen, but so far a complete shut down and re-start will fix it.The touch screen, when it does function, feels crude.The speed of the computer is adequate for the price. And the screen viewing angle is also adequate.But the case and keyboard feel like a cheap disposable toy.Obviously, I cannot recommend this, but I am lost as to what else I might choose. From what I can see, the other manufacturers are all just as cheesy.Good luck!Update - after 3 or so weeks. The computer has been stable and works as it should. The initial setup was a grind. But it has not re-booted itself for the last 3 weeks, and the touchscreen is functioning.",2,2,0,2,2
524,"I have to start off by saying that I'm a Chromebook fan. I've tested several and owned a few. There are still apps (when I was growing up, we called them ""programs"" and ""software"") that will only run on a PC, but I try when possible to take a Chromebook with me wherever I go because they are just so damn handy. Why is this important? Because this review is not here to hate on Chromebooks. They are great little machines. Many reviews hate the OS, and don't focus on the hardware when writing their reviews.Unfortunately, this 2017 Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6"" HD ""Premium Chromebook"" is not really ""premium."" For two Benjamins, it's still a better computer than NASA had for all the Apollo missions-- in the space crafts and on the ground combined. But I was expecting more. I have a 2015 Asus 10"" Chromebook which outperforms this 2017 15"" Chromebook, and they were both the same price. I was hoping to ""trade-up"" but it looks like I'll keep the mini Chromebook and just use this 15"" Chromebook as a spare at the office.My Chromebook arrived refurbished, and I knew that going in when I purchased it. But sadly, mine arrived with schmutz all over the case (mainly on the bottom, and along the sides). The screen and keyboard were (thankfully) clean. But the rest of the case was honestly gross. We're talking about dirt, skin oils, and maybe food stains. I don't know what. Someone should have wiped this down with a rag before shipping it. It was absolutely disgusting to receive it with visible stains and foreign material on it.The screen quality is decent-enough. Technically, it may be ""HD,"" but it doesn't pop with color and brightness like many other HD screens. Reading emails, the text is kind of soft and fuzzy compared to my Asus PC latpop screen and Asus 10"" Chromebook. I'd give the Acer 15"" screen a 7/10 in the visual department. Again, not bad for the price, but certainly not up-to-par with other laptop screens we're now seeing.The speakers are awesome. Not only are they of good quality, but they face up! Frankly, it should be international law that all laptops have upward facing speakers so that we can actually hear them.The keyboard is excellent. Feels pro-quality, and it's not too loud (some cheap laptops have a clickity-clack problem). Could use this on a plane in first class and not disturb the blue-blood next to you with his poodle and monocle.Where this Chromebook really fails is in power. Now, I'm not expecting Cray Supercomputer here (have I dated myself yet?), but I was disappointed when I tried to run 4k video from YouTube. It was a complete no-go. Not entirely unexpected, but I was hoping a ""premium"" Chromebook could handle it. What's more disappointing is that it hiccuped a bit even on 1080 HD video from YouTube. That's no bueno. I tried watching a couple videos on this Chromebook and compared it to my PC, and the Chromebook just didn't have the mojo or gusto or eye of the tiger.In summary, this Chromebook is a good value overall, but it's far from premium. For the price, it's a worthy contended, But if you like to watch HD Netflix or other streaming film, I think I'd look for another laptop of Chromebook with better video capabilities.UPDATE: The day this refurbished model was delivered, I noticed that Walmart had brand new ones for less money. I'll be returning this used model.",2,2,5,4,2

The fingerprints don't just wipe off either, you need a cloth and possibly a mild cleaner to remove the fingerprints (I don't eat at my computer so my fingers are fairly clean to begin with).

536,"The display in this laptop is a low-quality-TN type panel with poor contrast and viewing angles, which is considerably worse than the typical TN desktop monitors often covered in comparison videos, and I would say frankly doesn't make sense for a laptop costing this much. Companies are too-often keen on offering upgrades over already-good CPU/RAM specs, while dropping the ball on very noticeable components the buyers don't always know to check or know what standards to have for, such as the display. This is one of such laptops.This is the 5577 model, and the same used to be the case for the 7567 model, but Dell realized their mistake and partially addressed the problem by switching to an IPS panel on most sub-models in the USA and a few other regions. It is not a high-end IPS panel with 72% NTSC color gamut, but is a 45% NTSC IPS panel which I would say is to expect at the bracket this laptop is in.The 7567 also offers a NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti which is a bigger improvement over the GTX 1050 than the ""i7"" 7700HQ is over the ""i5"" 7300HQ, for most gaming. Intel's branding scheme I think is a bit misleading since basically any HQ-series outperforms any U-series regardless of the Core i-number, despite the i-number being the focus of most promotional materials, but that's an issue for another post. The main point I want to make here is that the Inspiron 7567 is a more recommendable option to me because of its better GPU and much less poor quality display.To get this, you need to choose the 7567 model and not the 5577 model you see in this listing, and you need to choose one that lists ""IPS"" for the display spec, since not all of them do. I recommend model FNCWF514S which has the IPS display, GTX 1050 Ti, and 256GB SSD. The RAM is upgradable, and the 2.5"" HDD bay is left open for storage expandability.You can choose to replace the display yourself, and if so I would probably recommend an AUO B156HAN01.2 or LG LP156WF6-SPB1 for 72% NTSC color gamut. That is the only case I think I could truly recommend the Inspiron 5577, and it's still a tradeoff because you won't get the better GPU that the 7567 offers. Here is a genuine and confirmed-compatible 72% NTSC replacement display:AU OPTRONICS B156HAN01.2 LAPTOP LCD SCREEN 15.6"" Full-HD DIODE (SUBSTITUTE REPLACEMENT LCD SCREEN ONLY.

538,"Styling-aside, no one should mistake this for a MacBook-class performance laptop, but what the CB+ sacrifices in speed and flexibility, it makes up for in battery life, convenience, and price.I have the pleasure of working across many different devices each week and have been using the CB+ for a few months now as a fallback, all-day WordPress editor and Google Apps biz box. For those purposes it's a mixed bag, but for the price of < $500 it's hard to complain too much: there is a lot here. Here's the breakdown from ~3 months use:PERFORMANCEAs others have said, if all you need is a casual email, web browsing, and the Google Apps suite, this device fits the bill and offers some great flexibility with the stylus and touchscreen. Once you get into more complex webpage renderings, use it for a biz where time = money, or intend to use storage outside of the Google ecosystem, things get more challenging. FTP clients are few and poorly designed, web page edits/reloads are slower than an entry-level iPad, and the ability to work across different cloud containers is often limited to the Android ecosystem, with its own issues (see below). In fact, as I am typing in this review box with 4 Chrome tabs and a couple Android apps open, the system is stuttering, pausing, and exhibiting an ever so slight lag when backspacing or typing quickly.DESIGNWorking long hours on my MacBook Pro is difficult with its sharp front edges. The CB+ solves for this with its rounded edges, light weight, and surprisingly thin width. I can throw it in a bag, forget its there, and use it all day without any concern over battery life. On the other hand, if you are buying thinking it is a cheap route to tablet XP, think again. The beauty of an iPad is its singular focus as a 1lb touchscreen you hold in your hand first and attach a keyboard onto at your desk later. Flip-book designs like the CB+ are 2lb+ laptops first, with software-accelerated passive styli designed to mimic the no-lag, active styli on iPad Pros and Surfaces. Its not the same thing and near impossible to hold in one hand for any length of time given the 2x weight, larger screen size, and power button you will grow tired of accidentally hitting as you balance the device on a knee or leg. This is 90% laptop, 10% tablet.SCREENThis is why you buy this device. Stunning and the showcase of the device. Given the lower performance specs, you could almost consider it a $400 touch screen with a keyboard attached. Easy on the eyes over long periods of working, with the flexibility of ratcheting up to eye-squintingly high resolutions when needed.KEYBOARDThe flip side of the light weight and thin dimensions is a squishy, cheap-feeling keyboard light years behind the clickety, tactile feel of the my MacBook (or even iPad Pro Smart KB case). The lack of caps lock and tiny tab and backspace keys make it a challenge to switch back and forth between this device and others. The absence of lighted keys (not surprising at this price) distracting when switching off higher-priced laptops.ANDROID APPSAndroid apps on Chromebook are a love/hate experience. Love: immediate access to local, offline apps far more enjoyable to use than web-based equivalents. Hate: apps run in a shared sandbox, one app crashes, they all crash out. While many apps do effectively scale up to full window resolutions, its generally an either/or experience: phone-sized mini windows or full screen Chrome ones. Apps are also limited in features, most stripped down to features applicable on a smartphone versus more complete feature sets you expect on a laptop. While impressive that developers have allowed their apps to scale to a full sized view, there is years of work needed to get these apps to a level commensurate to what you would expect to see on an iPad, which faced the same challenge of years of developers optimizing their iPhone apps for larger screens. In short, a great addition with strong promise, but years ahead of it to bring Chromebooks to the same level as their MS or Apple equivalents.SUMMARYAll in all a decent jack of all trades, master of none device for those on a tight budget and seeking a predominantly keyboard-driven, traditional laptop experience < $500. Anything above that and you're better off looking at an iPad + KB (faster, lighter, more versatile) or Mac/Windows laptop (faster, more versatile, better resale).",2,4,5,4,5

He took a look at it and declared it ""too wimpy"".. then opened it up, turned it on, and completely changed his tune. He now thinks it's the best laptop he's owned. It is small - but good things, they say, come in small packages. It is lightening fast. Husband is in finance and uses Excel. He opens up so many files at once, and does huge cut and paste between files. While his Dell would bog down and churn during these situations, the Microsoft Surface performs quickly and efficiently. Husband also loves the touch screen, though he was dubious at first. He adapted to it quickly and now prefers the touch screen to his old mouse.The laptop was easy to set up, right out of the box. The Introduction Screens walk you through setting up Wi-Fi, Cortana and a few other features. Simple for anyone. The graphics on the screen are amazing - clear and extremely high quality. We were both surprised to find no SD card port and it needs a different HDMI cable (mini display cord adapter $39). Apparently, you have to order a special (and pricey) compatible mouse ($79).We're no digital wizards or techie's.

581,"Initially I bought this through Amazon but cancelled quickly when I realized Microsoft offers a student discount. So far I have had this 2 days and it has not been bad but it certainly has not been great either. I don't think I had Windows 10 S for an hour before I quickly upgraded it Windows 10 Pro. As stated before Windows 10 S will NOT let you install 3rd party applications unless they are in the Microsoft store. So that means you are stuck with limited VPN options, Edge Browser, and a ton of other limitations. The trade off is real and significant. For Windows 10 Pro you can install the programs you want; however rest assured your battery life will suffer tremendously. I was at 100% about 20 minutes ago but after moderate use (no streaming videos or music) I am down to 92%. I think it is fair to say Windows 10 Pro kills the battery life Microsoft touted as being amazing. Microsoft informs users that you can downgrade back to Windows 10 S if you choose free of charge. The touch screen is nice as is the material surrounding the keyboard. The screen resolution is absolutely on point. I have the i5 8GB 256 GB model and I have to say it is much slower than I anticipated. It looks like many others are reporting the same thing. I'm not sure the more expensive i7 would make that much of a difference. In addition, the facial recognition software to unlock your computer is inconsistent at best and I could totally see myself strictly using the pin procedure to access if it keeps up its shenanigans. All and all it is a good attempt by Microsoft, does it beat it's Macbook Air counterpart? In my opinion, no. As I am deeply entrenched in both ecosystems, Apple and Microsoft (I love both) I can say with the utmost confidence that it is a good computer but not great and certainly not worth the hefty $1299 price tag.",1,2,3,2,4

As far as gaming, I've only run Terraria, but it handles it okay; there's just not a lot of free memory space to store much else.I ended up being frustrated with this computer for a bit due to Microsoft's massive GB requirements for updates, but was able to mitigate this by purchasing a 16GB USB Drive.

Samsung's build quality was very good, and the only reason I give this 2 stars, though giving an accurate star rating in this case is rather difficult.The reason I returned the Chromebook Plus is the ChromeOS constantly prompting me to enter my 30+ random character Google account password. Apparently there is some window of time, about 12 hours maybe, where if the device isn't used you have enter your full password. This is true even if you have a PIN set up, or if by some miracle you can get the bluetooth smartlock working with your phone. I could get my phone to connect by bluetooth for about 2 seconds, long enough for the chromebook to say smartlock was enabled, but after those 2 seconds my phone would show as disconnected. This happened over multiple connecting attempts.How this password issue can be the way it is given every Android tablet or phone, and Apple too, doesn't do anything similar is a serious failure of the UX design of ChromeOS. I'm sure there is some design manager on the team ready to claim this password feature is for my benefit.I hope someday this issue is resolved so we can get some decent Android like tablets coming out again.",2,4,5,4,5

Both feel a bit cheap.- Pen works fine, has palm rejection, but there is some input lag.- SD card slot is a necessity since on board storage is really low.- USB-C only (for peripherals and charging).It's brilliant package. Samsung cut costs where it did not matter too much and delivered on the overall experience for a low price. I thought the pen is just a nice bonus, but I use it all the time. Like it much more than the touchpad or using the finger on the screen. I also use the tablet and tent options more often than I thought. Especially when just reading though some documents. USB-C charging means that I can use my car charger, external battery and smartphone charger to charge it. It also means that I cannot simply connect a mouse or projector to it. That is just a matter of time though - USB-C makes it future proof, and you can get dongles for the old USB standard, HDMI, etc.SOFTWARE:- Full fledged chrome browser in the super safe Chrome OS environment.- First Chromebook to officially support Android apps.Basically this means that it is a super secure Android tablet with a full Chrome browser - so you can use AdBlock and all web apps. (there are many web apps, for example video conference systems that do not work on Android's Chrome browser)The Play Store with all Android apps works extremely well. There are still a few rough edges, especially in tablet portrait mode, but this will be taken care of in the coming months. The Play Store is still labeled ""beta"".With the addition of Android apps, you have full video playback support, professional file managers, photo editing software. This drastically changes the capabilities of Chromebooks in general.PLUS vs PROThe Pro version of the Samsung Chromebook has an Intel i3 CPU. This one has an ARM chip. While the i3 should be faster in normal operation in Chrome OS, the ARM chip is actually superior for Android apps since most apps are optimized for the ARM architecture.

613,"I replaced my HP Chromebook that died after 3+ years. I love chromebooks because of the fast startup time and the easy quick updates. I'm totally into the Google system, using their Google Docs, Spreadsheets, Gmail, etc. That said, The startup on the Samsung is S-L-O-W and scrolling is jerky. Faster than my PC but definitely slower than my older cheaper HP. I've tried it on two different WiFi networks just to make sure it wasn't my modem/network. The keyboard is very cramped and I find the muscles in the back of my hand tiring easily. The slimness of the unit makes finding a comfortable place to rest your arms while typing difficult. Stereo speakers are fine until you place the unit in tablet mode; because of placement on the back, the sound is terrible. The battery drains very quickly presumably because of the screen's high resolution; keep the charger handy! The promise of apps is still just a promise: the first two apps I tried on the unit would not work properly. Good stuff: I love the pen when I remember to use it for scrolling and clicking (I haven't used it to create sketches or art). I even signed an online document with it. Gorgeous screen. A lightweight unit overall and turning it into a tablet is cool (though I hesitate walking around the house with it for fear of dropping it, so I still use my lighter Samsung Galaxy Tab A). The other plus of this unit is that, as of this writing, Google will continue to update it for a whopping 6 years. That's the longest update guarantee I could find on any chromebook I was considering. So the high upfront cost of this unit is actually cheaper than others if you consider it is good for 6 years. Overall though, I really expected better performance, comfort and sound from this unit.",2,4,5,4,5
614,I use it to run music software i use maschine and cubase on it and i have no problems.

667,"This ASUS P-Series laptop is a no-frills computer that offers good performance for the price, but do not expect any premium features.This 15.6"" laptop has a textured matte finish all over...on the lid and on the interior area where you'll be resting your palms, and it's probably the nicest aesthetic that you'll find on this computer. Everything else says budget buy, but that's not really a bad thing here. Inside you're getting a quality 7th gen Intel i5 processor, along with 8GB RAM and a 1TB hard drive. The hard drive is a standard 5,400 RPM disc drive that can be slow at times. Out of the box there is hardly any bloatware to deal with, and after I ran a big initial Windows update I had over 930GB of usable disc drive space. But in general, the i5 processor keeps things moving and 8GB of RAM is just fine for MS Office, web browsing and light photo and video editing work.As far as the externals are concerned, the keyboard is a full-sized chiclet keyboard for the letters and home area. The keys travel as expected, but I couldn't type my fastest on this keyboard, just because the feel was a little off. It's completely functional, but I could only hit maybe 85-90% of my max typing speed on it. However, as a nice bonus, you do get a number pad, but you'll have to get used to the skinny number keys for filling in spreadsheets. I'd still always rather have a number pad, even if the keys are skinny, though. The touchpad, much like the rest of this computer, is functional and ok. There's nothing fancy about it, but it has a decent feel and the left and right clicks aren't too bad. Again, totally functional. There is also a finger print reader on the right side that works fairly well, but alternatively, you can use the webcam and Windows Hello to unlock your device with your face. The left side of the laptop has a VGA port (great for use at older podiums that haven't been upgraded), vents for heat dissipation, an HDMI port, an ethernet port, and 3 USB 3.0 ports. The right side has a laptop lock slot, a headphone jack and a USB 2.0 port. The front has a full-sized SD card slot that has a solid spring-loaded eject mechanism. Also on the right side is a DVD-RW drive. I love that you get a full suite of ports (Displayport notwithstanding) so you'll never have to compromise or bring adapters.The USB ports worked well, and the 3.0 ports do indeed give you SS transfer rates when using 3.0 thumb drives. I used the HDMI port to hook up to my monitor and it gave me 1080p HD with absolutely no lag or problems. You should be able to carry a higher resolution if you have the right HDMI cable and a 4K monitor (I do not have one and couldn't test it).Overall, this laptop performs very well for it's reasonable price. So why 4 stars instead of 5? Well, it's because you will have to make some compromises.First, the DVD drive is loud. Even if you don't have any discs in the drive, on start up this thing cranks and grinds for maybe 20 seconds. In a quiet office, everyone will hear it. The other thing that is sort of a bummer is the screen. It's 1920 x 1080p, and it isn't blurry or anything. But the viewing angles are a challenge. You only get a very narrow 10 degree angle where you'll see decent colors. And it isn't exceptionally bright or vibrant at any angle. I had to jack the brightness up to the 90 or 100% mark under almost all circumstances. The screen also has a substantial bezel on all sides. Considering this laptop is roughly half the cost of a comparable i5 Surface Pro, Spectre, or XPS 13, you will quickly realize that ASUS was able to set the budget prize largely by sacrificing screen quality. Again, fitting with the theme of this device, it's totally functional, but it's not premium. Next, at over 5 pounds, you'll notice the weight for sure. You do get a DVD drive and a bunch of ports, but the budget price comes with a hefty weight compromise. And finally, I notice that this laptop is being marketed for business and productivity. I think that is an ideal usage for this device, however, just be aware that it comes with Windows 10 Home and not Pro or Enterprise. You'll be limited what your IT department can do with this device unless you pay for the Windows download and upgrade.Even with those negative or compromising aspects of this laptop, I can only knock it down to 4 stars because you do truly get a lot for your money here. If you're on a budget but still need to get serious work done, this ASUS P-Series laptop will meet pretty much all of your needs. And if you spend a decent amount of time hooking it up to a monitor, you'll overcome the biggest shortcoming - the screen.",2,2,1,2,2
668,"Amazing ultrabook. I purchased mine refurbished and besides some faint scratching on the hinge, everything is perfect. Stellar battery life and performance. Fingerprint sensor is nice.

The replacement worked perfectly until now, less than 5 months later, the headphone jack isn't working anymore and the left side of the screen gets covered in flickering blue lines, like very fine graph paper half of the time. I have not dropped the computer or gotten it wet. Very dissatisfied with the product. For the price (over $500) it should be built much more sturdily and should at least last a few years without major hardware isues.

The touchpad is great after reboot, but becomes jumpy after 20 minutes of use or so. It has happened many times when I am using the file explorer (with nearly disastrous results)It could have been a decent laptop, but I wouldn't know. Unfortunately these problems make the laptop unusable for me.Sadly it's not an isolated case. I have 4 Asus laptops sitting in my house right now. Three of them have similar issues with the touchpad, two of them have issues losing my D drive. The Zenbook I have has issues with GPU overheating (even though it has a fan). They all have features that impress me initially, but fatal flaws have kept them from being useful.So ASUS, please:* Keep the current configuration, perhaps with more HDD space* Keep the lightweight and good battery life* Fix the issue with sticky touchpad (I have accidentally deleted files so many times because of it)* USB3 thumb drives have to work (I have lost a whole drive worth of data because of it)* Overall better quality control* I am willing to pay more if you fix the above problems",3,1,5,4,3

688,Had the laptop for around a month now. The most pleasing aspect of the laptop is the build. The laptop feels solid enough but at the same is not too bulky. I can carry it around for a day without hurting my back. The performance is great. Thanks to the ssd the laptop boots under 8s and other functions are smooth as well. Having an additional HDD certainly helps for gamers though it gives a feel that it takes forever to load games or softwares. The wireless connectivity options are working properly and provide great speeds on wifi. The most frustrating thing is the battery backup. Even with power saving mode on the laptop lasts hardly over an hour and a half. Plus the power saving mode gives the feel of working on a 4-year old netbook! Other than that the laptop has been a great revelation and as a fairly active gamer I'm quite happy with it.,1,0,1,2,2
689,"This is a nice setup for under $400. The laptop features the Intel i3-8130U 8th generation (latest generation for 4/2018, a 2 core processor), a 1TB drive and 6gb RAM. The battery is supposed to last for 12 hours (I tested this a bit but not a lot). The laptop has 6gb, a read/write DVD drive, and a lot of connections and a 1920 x 1080 display.The laptop is responsive and snappy for an under $400 laptop. Im a bit perplexed by some of the reviews claiming this to be slow. It is not. This value laptop has some chops. I loaded my desired suite of applications with Ninite dot com, that went quickly. In testing performance, I ran a Netflix movie and a show on YouTube at the same time with no performance degradation. I ran the 2+ hour movie twice while doing other stuff on the laptop and the battery still showed over 7 hours left.This laptop has a lot of connectors: USB, HDMI, and even a VGA connection (which I would suggest dropping, if you need that just put a HDMI/VGA adapter in your computer bag). Also included is the R/W DVD drive... something becoming rare in laptops. A nice option to watch movies if desired.The laptop display is good but has a poor viewing angle. I wasnt surprised, my guess is that this is the display was where trade-offs were made to get the laptop to this price. The display is hard to see from the side (a witty salesperson would claim this is great for privacy) and required tilting the display forward/back more than I liked to obtain the best viewing angle from the front.The speakers surprised me. The speaker volume is typical to most laptops in that I wish it would be about 20% louder at max. The speakers seems to be nice but not amazing, at least until I was lying on a couch watching a movie with the laptop on my chest. The nearness of my ears to the speakers allowed me to hear a very nice spacial mix of the sound.. the movie sound track ""bloomed"" at that point and was surprisingly good. Bear in mind, I practically had to have the laptop a foot or two from my face for this to kick in.Overall, for sub $400, this is a very nice performing laptop.",2,2,1,3,2

699,"Great laptop for budget gaming. Works well, turns on fairly quickly. I would recommend disabling windows updates, getting a different antivirus and disabling windows defender. Also very important go to your battery settings and set maximum processor speed to 85%.This will make sure the laptop doesn't get hot and throttle itself (slow down). It also saves a bit of battery.After all this, it plays fortnite at 1366768 on a mix of Med-High settings at a locked 30fps. Which isnt bad for a laptop in this price range.

Before you freak out about that, let me explain WHY the storage is so small. Chromebooks use what are called web apps. That means you dont need to (or more accurately, cant) download programs. That being said, dont expect to be downloading games and movies.The battery life is about 12 hours (unless you use the computer the way I do. Ill explain later)The camera looks good, albeit slightly grainy. Well, when its not skipping frames.With the main focus being on web apps, that would mean that you have to be online constantly to make the most use of the laptop. There are of course, a few offline comparable apps that you can find in the Chrome Web Store if you ever find yourself without connection.If you want to unlock the full potential (and very quickly run up your memory) you can take advantage of the fact that ChromeOS is Linux based and install Ubuntu.

Granted, I do not keep up with recent laptop technology as it hits the market, but compared to the Asus laptop that i have upgraded from that was new about 4 years ago, this product is an entirely new generation from my previous experience. I must say that still, after years of development the track pads of these more affordable laptops are still not nearly as good as the front runners, such as apple. Even with this downfall, the performance with the SSD makes the operating system really snappy and the ability to upgrade the RAM adds and included bonus for performance. This is by no means a performance gaming system that will deliver 4k or VR capabilities, but if you are looking for a decent, well priced laptop with incredible potential for general use, artistic and occasional gaming capabilities, this is the product you have been looking for! The keyboard feels nice, backlit keys(in just the red LED) is nice, 2 in 1 maneuverability is surprisingly useful(I like to put it into tent mode with a PS4 controller when I'm gaming), screen looks great, touchscreen is surprisingly responsive, speakers are better than expected, the red accenting looks nice and you just can't complain about what you have paid for. The only thing I would ask for is a more narrow bezel on the screen, but really, what does that matter?",2,0,3,2,2
723,"Update: I returned this unit.I came back to make sure I only gave it a one star. The lines in the screen never went away after waking from sleep, pressing again would correct it but, next time it slept the line in the screen would take over the whole screen.I literally hate this keyboard. The first couple of times even holding the unit, the keyboard detached and landed on my foot; man that hurt.I cannot even hold, open, or barely use the unit with the keyboard as it falls off way too easy.Even when I use it the keyboard flops all around. Opening the unit will separate the keyboard from the tablet causing problems with usage.I would much rather have the 2017 version with a hard keyboard; much like a laptop.I may be raving on and on but, I really feel strongly about my dislike for the keyboard setup.The display did freak out when I awoke it from sleep; it had lines running through it and could not read display.I hate to return things but, this one might have to go if it keeps up.I haven't used it that much yet but, the unit appears to be slow to respond.

727,Doing great so far,2,4,5,4,3
728,"INTRODUCTIONI bought this laptop, intending to use it for some business consulting work. I was traveling a lot so I figured it would be nice to have a prettylightweight laptop with a full keyboard that I could use to do emails, basic web browsing, and google docs.After receiving the laptop, Windows insisted that I run windows update to ensure the laptop was up to snuff, in terms of required software. After that finished, I used add/remove programs to ensure I didn't have any bloatware to slow the laptop down. Surprisingly, Asus didn't really include a whole lot other than the software required to do smart gestures on the trackpad (good on them for what used to be such an annoyingly common problem with retail PCs).PERFORMANCEInstead of describing how I felt about the way the laptop ran, I will instead describe what happened to this laptop when I operated it under a range of normal use scenarios.Checking Email:Gmail is a little slower to load than on most other PCs I've used. I also experienced an unusual phenomenon while typing in a blank: all keystrokes would take a very long time to register (for instance, if I had typed this sentence, it probably would have taken 10 seconds for the entire sentence to show up after I finished typing it out).Using Google Docs/Spreadsheets:The typing in a blank delay would occur constantly in a Google Spreadsheet, but was not present in a Google Doc.Using an online Messenger (Messenger.com):Delayed typing problem was worst on this site, which led me to believe that the UI was too much for the CPU to handle, affecting the ability of the computer to convert input keystrokes into output letters (this is very surprising, given that the marketing for this computer highlights how many cores the CPU has... I guess number of cores is truly meaningless if text output is a problem).Using Skype Messenger:No issues. I never tried a video call, so I cannot confirm whether any issues existed.Reading Articles Online (News websites, popular online magazines, etc):Probably the worst experience. Page loads were very very long. I can only imagine it is due to all of the complex ads that have taken over websites which demand a lot of resources. Not to mention, ads that loaded videos and started playing...Netflix:Surprisingly, no issues streaming. Navigating the Netflix UI was a little bit laggy, but it was not nearly as bad as some of the online news/magazine sites.Free Trial of Minecraft:I booted up the free trial to see how it performed, and I was shocked. The game runs very smoothly...My only guess is that the game could utilize multiple cores, while internet browsing couldn't take advantage of multiple cores simultaneously.HARDWAREThe laptop is indeed flimsy-ish as many of the other reviews note. However, I would like to say that it was not as flimsy as I expected based on those other reviews. There is a little flex when holding the laptop by one of the sides, but overall, it's decently solid for a $200 machine.The screen was definitely lacking, but better than I expected for the price point. It's glossy, non-touchscreen, backlighting was a great range of bright enough down to dim (for saving battery). I will say that it was not bright enough for the glare from reflections (e.g. if the sun was shining on my shirt and my shirt was a light color, I could clearly see the reflection of my shirt in the screen, even at highest brightness).The keyboard definitely uses membrane switches, which had a nice actuation feel considering how cheap this laptop is. The size of the keys were definitely smaller. The letters/symbols were printed on each key in a really cheap-looking finish. The plastic material that the keys are made out of was definitely low-grade.The trackpad was solid! It was large considering how small the laptop is, had a great feel (was smooth and easy to move about on), and right and left clicks are unmarked but easy to find in the lower right and left quadrants (respectively) of the trackpad. The Asus trackpad software that comes installed knows when you're resting your palms on the trackpad to type, and limits the mouse movement to only input from a finger (it's quite smart..).Webcam: not sure... never video chatted or used the laptop's camera.The form and finish of the laptop are nice. It is NOT metal, but the paint on the plastic does indeed look matte metallic from a distance. The shape was pleasing to hold while closed, and is likely perfect for any 11"" Macbook Air slipcase/carrier.OVERALLEverything about the hardware on this laptop makes me wish it performed better. It comes with a one year subscription to Office 365, and excel and word performed adequately. If this computer is for offline use only while traveling, it is probably perfect. I would hazard to guess that most websites design UI assuming most readers are using Macbooks and work PCs... this is certainly not the case. I have returned the PC, and will instead buy a $400 - $1000 ultrabook/2-in-1/macbook that I can use for internet/travel work.",3,1,5,4,3

734,"Not many people give this computer 5 stars but i do. The reason is primarily for the 1080p display. It makes reading text no matter what size wonderful. Everything works very well on this computer as well. The speakers are a little tinny which is to be expected on a budget laptop but their volume is loud.The first thing i did after the initial setup of a new computer is install a Samsung low profile 128 gb usb flash drive that stays in all the time. A usb flash drive is absolutely necessary on this computer to be able to update to Windows 10 version 1803. Then i went to Settings,System,Storage and told Windows to store everything to the usb flash drive. Then i installed a usb cordless mouse. And i still have one usb port open.It was a struggle to get Windows 10 version 1803 to update as there were about 8 other updates at the same time. The usb flash drive is mandatory in assisting the update process. There still wasn't enough space even after running Disk Cleanup and clicking on Cleanup System Files, putting a check mark in all the boxes and ok it. I did that 3 times at different intervals of the updating. I had to uninstall the 1 month trial version of Office 365 and tried to update again. Still failed. So i uninstalled three games Which could have been moved to the usb flash drive but i chose to just delete them. That was enough and it updated to Windows 10 version 1803! Then i ran Disk Cleanup again cleaning up system files and i had a whopping 13.5 gb of free space on the 32 gb emmc drive.Windows 10 has a few foibles like saying the flash drive has errors and wanting to scan and fix it. It doesn't. And the power button won't put the computer to sleep but closing the lid does. I can live with these things. I think it is a great buy.",3,4,5,4,3

It has some cool features but there are some things I miss about my Toshiba Chromebook.Pros:- Form factor - it's extremely thin- USB-C - has a USB C on each side for charging/connectivity. The nice thing is you can plug the charger in whichever side is convenient. Of - course no turning the connector over to figure out how it goes in - it's about time!- Android apps - this is the first Chromebook built from the bottom up to run Android apps. Now I can play Words with Friends and run most of my other apps as well.- Converts to tablet - this plus the fact that it runs Android apps makes it very convenient- Stylus - it's cool although I don't use it very often yet.- Bright screen with 4x3 ratio - the 4x3 ratio is actually more useful than the widescreen notebooks. Makes for more usable space.Cons:- No backlit keyboard - really? For a $400 Chromebook one would think this would be a given.- The keyboard - I can't put my finger on it but these keys are hard to get used to. Backspace key is too small and hard to hit (I make a lot of mistakes)- Trackpad - not very responsive. The tap to click doesn't work very well, not near as good as the Toshiba I traded in for this. This is one of the biggest cons to me because I use the trackpad all the time.- Android apps are buggy - Android support on Chromebooks is still in Beta status and it shows. Apps crash or don't display very well. It's the price you pay for being on the bleeding edge.- Speakers in the bottom - not sure what Samsung was thinking. Probably the worst place to put speakers. Volume is just barley adequate and completely inadequate in a loud room.Those are the high points.

771,"I truly wanted to like this laptop. But after buying 2 (1 from Best Buy and the other from the Microsoft Store) and experiencing the same problem, I have to call it quits. I can't find anyone else talking about this problem: there is sound distortion, and it's not a defect, it's simply an effect of the design. Let me explain.The speakers in this laptop are placed somewhere under the keyboard. When the sound is turned high up (typically 70/100 or higher), and under certain music, the sound waves coming from the speakers under the keyboard cause some of the chiclet keys to vibrate a lot. These vibrations produce high pitched buzzing noises. The kind of music I have found this most noticeable on is classic piano music. At first I thought I had a busted speaker. However upon returning the laptop and getting another with the same problem, I had to do some investigating. Eventually I found that when I touch some keys to prevent them from vibrating, the distortion goes away, and when I let go it comes back.I simply can't deal with this. It is extremely noticeable to me. Otherwise this laptop is great. It has the best keyboard of all the ones I've tested which was really important to me. Such a shame...",0,2,3,2,4
772,"I wanted to give 5 stars to this beautiful machine.However, I have been using it just some days and there are two important things that are not working well ... both seems to be real problems with the computer:1) The touch screen only works now with the pen. No matter what I do, my fingers won't make it to react.2) The WIFI it is not stable, compared with any other device connected to the same data source.What I understand is that both are real issues for many users (checking recent complaints), and the big question is if they are software and/or hardware problems. If this is about some configuration or driver update, I can wait for the software to be updated ... but if this because a hardware failure, then Samsung must define an update path, maybe to recall the machines and to fix the problems for next ones before they are shipped.Taking these two problems out of the equation, the Chromebook it is a fantastic device. The only need to be taken into consideration is that metal body machines are prone to scratches, so be careful.",2,4,5,4,5

818,"Past history has been using pcs & mac, so this 2 in 1 was my our first enticement into chromebooks. I bought both a pro & a plus to share largely with my son who is in high school. This is my review of the plus. I see 50% of reviews rate it as 5 stars & 20% rate it 4 stars. To be fair I rate it 4 stars. My top 5 drawbacks of the plus are its (i) can lacks power multi-tasking, (ii) low speak volume, (iii) touchpad over-sensitively when typing, (iv) limited android apps compatible with SCP, (v) no forward camera (which is needed by some apps). My top 5 likes are: (i) stylus, (ii) screen resolution, (iii) chromebook environment - inbuilt virus protection, low IT demands of its software, (iv) usefulness of apps that do actually work, (v) its portability. Compare to the pro, the plus does lack some power to multitask, but the battery life of the plus lasts a few more hours which is its main benefit over the pro. The plus isn't as nice looking as the pro and will pick up scratches and wear more obviously. Overall I'm happy with the plus, but i would like its durability to last at least 2.5 years to say that it a was worth the investment.",2,4,5,4,5

Extremely disappointed especially for the price paid. Computer now at Lenova repair for possible repair/fix. We will see. All I know is I will never buy a Lenova again!!!! I have never written a review previously, but felt I had no option other than leave one for this product.",2,1,1,2,2
822,"Where do I even start with this thing? It's so nice, literally, have your friend pick it up and watch their face. They will be amazed at how light it is. Then show them the benchmarks...and mention the battery life. This laptop has made my mind blow.Display:The display is very vibrant, even though it's nowhere close to being OLED, the blacks are very deep, and everything is very vibrant. Not sure how color accurate it is, but man it looks awesome. It's 1080p, which is totally fine, it's only 13.3"" and you only see pixels if you put your face up to the screen. The bezels are very small, which makes it seem super futuristic. It doesn't get super bright, but for me, that isn't too big of a deal. I came from a 2014 13"" MacBook Pro w/ Retina Display, and it's not quite 'Retina' quality, but that's why this gets 12 hours of battery and the Mac gets 5.Design:Personally, if I had to make the purchase again, I'd opt for the gray one. The white is very pretty, but it's less than a week old at this point and it is a little dirty already. Not a huge deal as I wipe it down when I see a smudge, but just make sure to always have handy wipes available if you want your laptop to look good. The overall look isn't gaudy, and nobody will recognize it from a distance, but man the 'gram' insignia on the lid looks classy. Like really good. The plastic bezel is okay, not my favorite, but what are you gonna do?Build Quality:The display flexes A LOT! Like you're not ready for it. However, other than that, it feels premium, yet cheap at the same time. When you take the laptop out of your bag for the first time of the day, you'll feel the cold metal, but then you start to feel that it's plastic. The Nano-Carbon Magnesium Alloy is nice, however, it can be felt as plastic, which is the carbon layer on top of the magnesium. Not a huge deal, but something you might want to watch out for.Battery:It's crazy long, crazy crazy. I unplug it at 6:45 AM and use it all day until about 4 PM and it's only at 40%. I'm so not even sure how they made it so good. It's 72 Wh, which is huge, especially for a laptop that's so small and that only has a 1080p display. Most other laptops at this price point and especially ones that are this thin and light don't even come close to the battery life of this thing.Performance:The new 8th-gen Core processors are just awesome. They have very little power draw, yet they're super powerful. My old Mac had a 4th-generation dual-core i7. This thing more than doubled the performance of that, it's incredible. The 8GB of ram gets used up quickly, so I'd recommend upgrading to 16GB by yourself, just buy another 8GB SODIMM on Amazon, and pop it in yourself.Keyboard & Trackpad:The keyboard is pretty good, a bit mushy, but personally, I prefer this. The trackpad is using Windows Precision drivers, which makes it very usable. It feels natural, not quite as good as the Mac trackpad, but honestly way better than I would have thought. LG really hit it out of the park on this keyboard/trackpad combo.Verdict:Absolutely pick up this laptop if you're a performance enthusiast and someone who wants a 2lb laptop that has enough power for the day and enough battery to let you work for more than 12 hours straight. Buy one, now. You won't regret it. I promise.",3,2,3,2,4
823,Its a pretty good laptop it just doesnt seem durable I read other reviews of other people complaining about the pieces in the back of the laptop breaking off and i thought mine would be different.

825,"With all the hype out of C2E2 about the Chromebook Plus (and its big sister, the Chromebook Pro coming out in April) being THE Chromebook for the next generation, I decided to pre-order it on Amazon. Now having played around with it for a few weeks, I can say that despite some of the hiccups, I find the Chromebook Plus a great productivity tool, and provided Google follows through with its updates to Chrome OS, could very well live up to the hype. Keyword: COULD.NOTE - This is my first Chromebook, so other than the stylus, I don't know if the other qualities are common among other Chomebooks or are unique to the Chomebook Plus.WHAT I WAS LOOKING FORI was looking to replace my Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241, which has served me well, but wasn't quite meeting my goals. I am a private & online tutor, so I needed a productivity machine that met the following criteria:1) Boots quickly.After logging in, loading Windows Vista, anti-virus, anti-malware, & VPN, my old Toshiba would take a good 90-seconds from Power button to user ready. Then add 15 seconds to find the proper file for my student, that amount of waiting was simply not going to cut it.2) Responsive touchscreen & quality stylus.If you can live without a stylus, then definitely look elsewhere, as you can easily find Chomebooks of comparable quality for +$100 cheaper. But I use a web whiteboard for my tutoring sessions, so a responsive, accurate stylus was essential. I resorted to a Huion tablet accessory for my Toshiba, but I was getting tired of constantly plugging in hardware, so I wanted to shell out extra for a built-in stylus.3) Access to Google Play apps.This was supposed to be THE game changer. Without the apps, Chromebooks were glorified web browsers, but with the apps, they would elevate Chromebooks to the perfect blend of laptop power & mobile responsiveness. And as a Google fanboy, anything that could make the Google ecosystem feel seamless was my kind of machine.CHOOSING THE PLUSSo with those goals in mind, three products seemed like good candidates: the Chromebook Plus, the Asus C302CA-DHM4 12.5-in touchscreen, & the Surface Pro 4. The Chromebook Plus was the only product to fit all those goals; the Asus lacked a stylus, & the Surface Pro did not have access to Google Play apps (though to be fair, the main reason I didn't go with the Surface Pro was, despite being a superior machine in most respects, the base model was $779 without the keyboard, a $329 premium to the $449 Plus which included a keyboard, not-backlit, but still...).THE REVIEWSo my choice secured, does the Plus live up to expectations?1) Boots quickly?Emphatically YES!Upon touching the power button, the login screen loads within 5 seconds. While I would have liked the Plus to support biometric logins like fingerprinting or facial recognition (like the Surface Pro's Windows Hello), Chrome OS includes a Smart Lock option that will unlock your Plus if your local Android phone is unlocked. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that supports fingerprint scanning, so with a swipe I can unlock my Note 4, which then unlocks my Plus. Total time from power up to user-ready: less than 10 seconds.2) Responsive touchscreen & quality stylus?Touchscreen, yes. Stylus, mostly.For folks concerned about the responsiveness of the ARM chip, fear not. The Plus is lightning quick, and I havent had problems with the touchscreen (though I'm the type to have less than 10 tabs open & maybe two apps on at a time, so you might require more horsepower than I do).As for the stylus, its a good piece of hardware. Its not the S-Pen of Galaxy Note 4 fame, but it makes saving screenshots & taking notes a breeze. When using it on my web whiteboard, there is a slight lag, maybe a few milliseconds. Nothing terrible, but writing doesnt quite feel as seamless as I wouldve liked.3) Access to Google Play apps?Its a mixed bag.Im willing to give the Plus the benefit of the doubt here, as many of the apps on Play are designed for smartphones & not tablets, so many of the apps just feel awkward. I play Lichess, and while the game plays fine, the text still stays mobile-sized, making the app feel like vast stretches of the plains; it just goes on forever. I also use the Skype app, but when the video screen docks you cant move or resize it, which can be annoying if it blocks a tab you need on Chrome. I also just recently had some issues with Skype freezing. Despite the problems with apps, Google redesigned the web interfaces for Drive, Docs, Sheets, & Voice such that Google specific apps arent really necessary.Another quirk is that, unlike the Chrome web browser, Android app windows cant be manually resized. You only get two choices: standard window, or full-screen. This is supposed to be corrected with the update to Android 7 Nougat, so maybe Ill change my tune when it comes out. But Play Store experience certainly feels like a Beta, so expect some hiccups.MISCELLANEOUS - DESIGNI do like the design of the chassis, though it has already accumulated some minor scratches on the undercarriage. I had to get used to the more compact keyboard & the smaller DEL & TAB keys, and Google stealthily replaced the traditional Caps Lock key with a Search key, so I had to go into settings to change its function back. As a tablet it feels awkward with the keyboard facing the back, but it feels sturdy, so Im willing to make that tradeoff.SPEAKERSI love watching YouTube videos, though out of several hours of YouTube viewing, on three occasions the speakers developed a crackle or sizzle for 5-7 seconds. I was a bit concerned about this, but the last occurrence was about 10 days ago. Im not much of an audiophile, but if this does become bothersome, I will update my review accordingly.BLUETOOTHI occasionally use Bluetooth headphones, & while I have no problems with connection during video playback, it will disconnect after a minute of silence (without you knowing, by the way).THE VERDICT - GETS THE JOB DONE, THOUGH STILL A WORK IN PROGRESSOverall, Im very happy with my purchase. Its responsive, boots fast, & maximizes the Google experience that few products can replicate. Its not perfect by any means, but sometimes thats the price of novelty. If you're looking for a basic Chromebook who doesnt need a stylus or Google Play access, at the Plus will seem overpriced. But in comparison to tablet-hybrids with a stylus like the $779 bare-bones Surface Pro or the $799 12.9-in iPad Pro, the Plus, at $449, while imperfect, is still a tremendous value.",2,4,5,4,5

833,"ASUS E200HA - I am a Student, Gamer, Tech nerd, and most important Picky. I've owned and built many desktops/laptops in my years of experience. From the low end laptops to the high end I've experienced them all. ASUS has always been one of my favorite brands but I will be completely unbiased for this review. The E200HA is a portable, light weight laptop for the average person. There are hundreds of portable laptops all varying in price, build quality, and components. With a 11.5 inch LCD screen and slim body structure and light weight construction this is the smallest laptop I've ever owned and it takes a lot to get used to, but I purchased this laptop for the soul purpose of having a School laptop that's able to multi-task and run the programs I need which conveniently it comes with Office 365 for free for 1 year which is super helpful.-The keyboard itself is amazing, It's definitely one of the best keyboards out of my laptops for being the size it is. Very satisfying to use, the texture, size of the keys and the overall size of the board it's self is nice-The screen is not as bad as some people have made it seem to be. Obviously people want 4k retina displays, but for what this laptop was designed to be used for it's above it's standards. Watching youtube videos was just like another laptop with Full HD 60 FPS videos-The speakers are quite alright for videos as well, but if you don't use headphones for watching videos anyways where are you?-The track pad is very nice with a responsive feel, the left and right click are responsive and nice to use as well. And most important is the track pad functions are nice also making scrolling, zooming and using other features like Cortana easy. Although I do prefer using my wireless mouse for any laptop I did give this a chance and I would definitely be able to leave my mouse at home knowing I wouldn't hate my life with every second of using this laptop-Web browsing/Multi-tasking is super good for using a Atom processor and only having 1GB of cache. I've had youtube videos playing in the background while being on two amazon web pages, one CPU boss web page, random science web page, and using the Instagram app. On top of that using Microsoft word for my science project about Florida Snakes ;). The only part that was annoying was highlighting, copying and pasting from one website to word. This is probably the most if not more than someone would be doing on this laptop unless you own 3 businesses, run a youtube channel, go to school and like to do random web browsing in your spare time.-Gaming... It plays flash games, Minecraft and a little bit of Counter-strike but at medium to low graphics. And if you happen to get into a big fire fight... Oh boyOver all this laptop is worth all the 200$ I spent and will definitely have this ready for my portable needs.. And even some counter-strike because I'm EDGY",3,1,5,4,3

854,"1. This laptop has some sh*tty thermal paste, so the cpu temperature hits 50C Idle and 95C at full load, but if I repaste it on my own, I'm pretty sure they'll void the warranty.2. Hello Acer ! it is a gaming laptop, not a toaster... The bios is almost unusable, all features are locked and hidden except boot menu. I can understand if they hide voltage and frequency control features as they can physically damage the device, but they have hidden such features as hyperthreading, VT-D, VT-X. You can't switch between intel integrated and Nvidia video cards. Also there is no power consumption preset feature in bios as in Predatorsense, so I can't use it from other operating systems like linux.3. Battery dies in 2 hours just by web browsing, probably because of high cpu temperature.4. All other parts - gpu, ram, hdd, display, keyboard, touchpad, webcam, dvd drive, io ports works fine.And finally, this means that Acer treats us as if we were some stupid kids and we don't need advanced features in bios, which makes this laptop unusable for professional programmers and artificial intelligence researchers like me.******* U P D A T E ***********Warning ! disassembly may void your warranty.I disassembled my laptop and applied new thermal paste Arctic MX-4. After repasting, CPU temperature dropped from 96C to 74C (when only cpu was used)but when both CPU and GPU are utilized at 100%, CPU gets 98C and GPU gets 90C.you can see on screenshots1.

Seems very sturdy. Absolutely no problems with it right out of the box. I guess, if I had to change anything, I'd get the same computer with a Chromebook OS instead of MS. But the MS OS works fine.

The display is better than what you can get from any other brand at this price. This laptop is pretty darn sick. My new laptop would be coming from ASUS. This price point is sick, specs are sick, display is sick, build quality is sick and touchpad, keyboard and speakers are sick all for the price of $200 when I bought this.Good Job ASUS!

No. No it is not.After installing ONLY firefox and nothing else, the hard drive is full and I get a message every day that Windows cannot update because there is no memory left. This is totally unacceptable, and there is NO way that HP didn't know this. HP knew this going in, and shipped the thing with a hard drive that is too small to even accommodate the OS.This thing is a rip off if you want to do anything with it other than look at email.

I just keep it cool and dont use it heavily while it is charging. The battery lasts a whole day of graduate school filled with writing reports and watching therapy. The keyboard takes a minute to get used to if youre transitioning from a larger laptop but once you adjust it isnt a problem.

It is lighter and slimmer than previous laptops Ive had and has an attractive brushed metal finish that really appeals to me.My only complaint is that the Delete key is right next to the Power button. This, according to Murphys Law means that the likelihood that you will accidentally shut the computer off will increase in direct proportion to the importance of the document you are working on.

908,"I gave this laptop a shot after reading mixed reviews. I have been searching for a budget laptop under $500 for quite a while now. We use Lenovo machines at work and have enjoyed using them so I kept Lenovo in mind while shopping. I realize there is a difference between consumer and business computers. I was impressed with the quality of products and customer service from the business perspective that I thought I could expect a similar experience with a consumer model. Boy was I wrong.Out of the box the display lid was very loose. It wobbled back and forth while I was typing. The fans were loud as other reviewers have stated. The hard drive was also noisy, and occasionally made a clicking sound. I understand mechanical hard drives will make noise, but I have been around these type of hard drives long enough to know that when it starts clicking it will fail at some point very soon. The plastic was cheap and flimsy, probably not going to last past the warranty expiration.I have been using budget laptops for 10+ years, and I have never been so disgusted in the quality of the machines available today. I understand compromises are made to keep machines affordable at the budget level. I can deal with a low quality, non hd TN display, or a mechanical hard drive, or even a plastic build (solid build quality, not hollow plastic).These large companies need to stop cutting corners on entry level consumer products. I have had a similar experience with HP, Asus, & Acer. For a machine that is nearly $400 in 2018, this is unacceptable. My coworkers were even shocked to hear about my experience with a Lenovo product. I cannot recommend this product to anyone.",1,4,1,3,2

It is a well rounded, very competent entry into the business laptop category and should be a consideration, price wise, for those who might be thinking about dropping 2-3 times as much for a surface laptop.First, the negatives:1) It is all plastic. When I first saw this online, I thought it was metal top at least, if not entirely metal. Nope, etched plastic made to look like brushed aluminum. F-2) It has a DVD in it. What?!??! Did we hop in the DeLorean and ride back to 2007? Totally unnecessary today, as external DVDs are cheap and have a better form factor, plus the space could have been used for 1-2 SSD.3) It ships with 8 gigs of ram, which also is a plus (more on that and check the attached photo).The Positives:1) SHIPS WITH NO BLOAT WARE!!!! HALLELUJAH!2) Windows 10 updates to the Creators Edition as soon as you turn it on.3) Can drive two external monitors at 1920x1080 with ease.4) Keyboard is so-so, a decent size keyboard, but lacks good tactile feel. Call this one even.5) Ships with 8GB ram... IN ONE RAM STICK! YAY!Updating this thing to 16 gigs is a snap. Just remove to the two screws on the back panel and gently slide the panel towards you. You will happily see an empty DDR4 Ram slot for you to put another one in. It is highly recommended you get another 8 gig ddr4 ram chip right away. You will see some improved performance since Double Data Rate 4 chips want to be installed in pairs. From an article...""As was already stated, in order to optimize memory performance so that it operates in ""dual channel"" mode, you need to have matched pairs of memory sticks installed. If you have just one stick of the required pair your memory will operate in the less-than-optimal ""single channel"" mode.""So, the memory in my Asus is Samsung 8gb PC4-2400T. For optimal memory performance, the chips must have the same timing and latency numbers. I'm going to try to find the specific memory chips and paste a link here... I'm not sure you will get the best performance if you use other chips.Edit: Found it. I did not find the memory chip on Amazon, but did find it on a certain ""egg""y other site, of the ""new""ish variety. The chip is SAMSUNG NOTEBOOK MEMORY 8G 1Rx8 PC4-2400T-SA1 (8G DDR4 2400), and you can find it directly by googling ""Samsung DDR4 M471A1K43881-CRC. I'd do a direct link to the other online retailer, but I understand that through the Amazon EULA everyone agreed to, if I did that Jeff Bezos would get to punch me in the groin.

The cooling system can keep the temperature of the laptop down enough that it does not have any problems. This machine also has the ability for you to add an extra hard drive in case you need it. Screws are included in the box so that if you decide to buy another hard drive, you can install it right away. One problem that I do have that I have seen other people having is that my laptop will randomly shut off when not charging.

927,Fantastic product. This laptop is a step up from the previous product which only had the skylake 6 series. The 8th gen processor handles some really impressive things for the price. The only thing is that pesky 5400rpm hard drive. Simply buy a 2.5 ssd and a Sata to USB adapter. Plug the drive into the pc and use macrium reflect to copy the drive as soon as the computer is set up. Then pop out the old drive and insert the new ssd. It blows even my aging desktop out of the water. Even without a discreet card the graphics are impressive. It easily outputs 4K with less than 50% draw on integrated graphics. Although it might be limited for rendering and such. My biggest qualm is that the older model had a backlit keyboard that was great.

Also the bios is pretty bare bones not many options at all like on the alienware. Maybe 2-3 setting you can change compared with like 20 on the alienware. Mine did have g-sync but that also means no intel graphics so battery life is pretty bad. I get around 2hr with my alienware I used to get 3hr though it had the 99whr battery much bigger than the one on this laptop.Positives are the sound is better keyboard and build are not that bad. Overall if you can get at a decent price it's a soild buy. Has 4 ram slots so can support 64gb ram also you can swap out the 1080p screen for a 4k screen like I did if you want. just don't expect to be able to game in 4k but it's great for 1080p gaming and 4k video streaming.,2,0,1,0,1

There's also other better versions of this laptop.",1,4,1,3,2
954,"I've previously owned Asus, but this computer, similar to my last one, is very slow on start up (probably due to all of the Asus startup programs). The main issue, however, is the computer is less than 3 months old and system will not run on battery power -- it doesn't recognize the battery. I am returning it to Asus and will post more on how the issue was handled.",2,2,1,2,2
955,"I purchased my laptop about 8 months ago. It has a couple of huge issues. First, every once in a while it will stop responding to any keys. It has to be hard shut down using the pin hole on the bottom. This has happened about 3 times since purchasing the computer. The second issue is that one of the speakers makes a loud static noise when the laptop starts to get warm. It happens really fast when you do any kind of VR or play games. It is too loud to keep playing.Acer Customer Service is worse than these issues. The agents are really hard to understand and Acer will force you to ship your laptop to them, AT YOUR EXPENSE, so they can work on it.I will never buy anything from Acer ever again.",2,0,1,0,1

960,"Junk, bought it for my 12 year old son for Christmas. The charger broke almost immediately, ordered another, it broke, ordered another, now the charging port itself is bad. All this in 6 months.

If you're going to get this laptop, you absolutely must pay the extra cost for the SSD combo as that what makes this a really good deal.",1,4,1,2,2
964,"Very happy with this laptop. It's SO pretty. It was very easy to set up ad get up and running. Had MS Office and internet in minutes.I don't mind the keyboard at all. No problems there.Video and sound are great.Only reason I knock off one star is that I don't like the touch pad. It's either over sensitive or not sensitive enough. Mouse will randomly slide across screen, have to hit the left and right tabs too hard. I ordered a mouse, and I'm sure after that it will be perfect!It is simple and streamlined. Probably wouldn't recommend for anything complex at all. But if you just want a low priced machine for word processing and basic internet, it's wonderful.",3,2,1,4,2

The laptop just looks nice, from the backlit keyboard to the clear bright screen. It starts up quickly. The specs are impressive and It has performed great so far with internet use, photo editing, word processing, and some Steam gaming. I dont think this would be the best system for a hardcore gaming machine, but its great for games that are not extremely system demanding. It has a good size hard drive which is a definite plus. Overall, an nice machine that should perform well for someone needing to do typical home computer work and light gaming.",1,2,1,2,3

Battery life is excellent. Charging to full power is very fast. I really like it. The only draw back I found was chromebooks can not download java programs which is why I needed a laptop.

983,"The ASUS P-Series P2540UA-AB51 business standard Laptop is a great laptop on paper. Its packed with a 7th gen i5 processor, a full 1080p matt display and 8gb ram with a 1tb HDD. On Top of this, it is packed with business essential tools that make it not only easy for the individual but for IT as well. It has a fingerprint detector, wake up on LAN and a great, true to spec 9-hour battery.While this is great in terms of specs, when it comes to actually using the device it is a disappointment. One of the major grievances of this laptop is its display. The viewing angles are absolute garbage, and it will quickly darken if your off center when viewing your screen. The dpi is terrible as well, making things look more pixelated than they are. It's definitely a lower range 1080p display. Next, there are issues with the keyboard, in my experience, the keyboard is not nearly as responsive as it can be. I am writing this review on this pc, and often it seems like there are missed inputs, and for a laptop that advertises itself as a business-friendly pc, a business pc should have a great keyboard as its likely to be used to write documents.Then there are many other minor issues that cause complications between the software and the hardware of the pc. You will have to do a lot of troubleshooting with this laptop as features will seamlessly disable themselves and break with updates. There are issues with the fingerprint reader, it seems like every time I fix it, on the next restart it breaks again. This definitely seems like a driver issue that needs to be addressed. Additionally, the touchpad stopped working for me after uninstalling the Office application that comes factory loaded and had to go and get new drivers(Asus gestures) to fix it.Additionally, while this following issue is more of an individual case, my laptop came with a nongenuine version of windows. I had to go through Microsoft and get that issue fix, and that adds on to my displease with this laptop.I bought this laptop for business use, but unfortunately, the experience has left me with a bitter taste. The laptop does have some positive such as its hardware i5 and 8gb of ram, Its 9-hour battery life and average weight for being a 15.6 traditional laptop. Its ease of access to upgrade its HDD and ram, which I, of course, switch its HDD for an SSD. It's a disappointment when utilizing the hardware and it seems much more of a waste when basic things like the screen, keyboard, and touchpad are horrendous. Overall, I personally would not recommend this laptop, while the internals seems great, its executed in such bad matter that makes this laptop a disappointment.",2,2,1,2,2
984,"Overall I'm fairly satisfied with this laptop. It can handle anything I throw at it such as battlefront 2, on medium/high settings, WoW, league of legends, dragon age Inquisition, mass effect Andromeda and others.Okay so the stuff I have issues with, with most games the fans kick on really quickly, and thats good, but thing is the y are loud and have a barely tolerable medium high pitched whine. If you put the speakers to about 3/4 up and or have headphones your okay but I'm not down with it. Next is the backlit keyboard, which looks dope by the way. Unlike most laptops this keyboard only stays lit for a period of time unless your gaming. It's cool if your using a power saver mode but if your in a dark room an FPS ya may have a moment where you press the wrong key. Lastly but not least, the hard drive which is a Terabyte of hybrid storage, is okay, but if you truly want to have a really great experience with this you should get an M.2 drive and stick it in their and install windows on it so the OS is fast. The fans are loud but they do work well and especially with the overboost feature.Overall I enjoy gaming on this, there's just a few things that I had to get used to. This is mostly due to me buying a pure Asus ROG. This shares the body of the ROG Strix but it's components are slightly different. I give it four out of five stars.",2,0,1,2,1

I want my freaking money back! I'm so upset with this purchase! This is money I could have spent on more important things. I bought this laptop to help further my career. HUGE disappointment.,3,1,5,4,3
992,"Maybe I haven't been lucky with this laptop. Sometimes the cursor would just disappear. When I called a technician, he suggested that I buy a wireless mouse, which I did.

993,"Works pretty well, took 5 hours to update ugh!I also uninstalled a lot of things that made it slow from the beginning now it's very fast.The fan is medium noise sometimes and than very quiet.The only thing is Skype. I think this laptop dont take in light well.I may have to play with the camera settings. Because in the morning with plenty light it shows very clear to the person I'm skyping with, more detailed he says.But at night with all the lights turned off ,you can only see my face if you turn on the brightness at full power. May have to call Dell about that. Because my old laptop I could use the light from the person I'm talking to would highlight my face very well without turning up my brightnessManages to hold a charge for about 4-5 hours. Also when turned off I still save battery.Very light which is good and awesome that is has a touchscreen which I most likely won't use much because I don't want handprints on my screen. The sound is very good because the speakers is actually at the bottom, but can still hear clearly.I'll update in about two weeks to make sure this laptop works perfectly.Also I do not use this laptop for gaming. It's primarily for Skype and watching kdrama, anime,and other tv show purposes.Update: 2/9/18For a brand new laptop I had to send it to dell for repair because the Fan needed replacing. There was a cinstantvticking noise. I'm returning because I should not be sending a brand new Laptop for repairs.",2,2,0,2,2

I'm not sure if the claimed 22hours of battery life is possible under linux but it certainly does well over 14 because at one point I had it running for about that long thinking it was powered up and then discovering that the wall socket wasn't switched on.I bought this expecting to be forced to run Windows 10 on it - which wouldn't be terrible but was not what I wanted. To my pleased surprise when I tried to install Xubuntu 17.10 it installed flawlessly and the upgrade shortly afterwards to 18.04 was equally painless.I have kept w10 on it too to dual boot and w10 works fine too.

1014,"Have had this laptop for 7 months now. Purchased it mostly to use as note-taking/writing for classes, light browsing, and a light computer to access PDF's of books.About 3 months into owning the laptop, the wi-fi card would need to be disabled/re-enabled in order to connect to wi-fi after starting up (I've already contacted support twice about this, to which they just said ""update the driver"" even when it already had the latest driver straight from their website).Another issue is the MicroSD card slot is a hit-or-miss too. Being that the notebook only comes with 32gb of storage, most of which is taken up by Windows and it's apps, a SD card is a must in order to be able to have anything on this computer. Sadly, after waking the computer from sleep, the card is not read, or the card is randomly disconnected from the computer, which can be a nuisance if you're viewing a book PDF. Again, I contacted support regarding the issue, and was given the same response of ""update the driver.""Lastly, the right speaker has stopped functioning, drivers and all already updated and the typical trouble-shooting completed. I've yet to contact support about this issue but seriously do not expect much help from them outside of their usual response as shown above.If I were to do it over again, I wouldn't waste my money on this laptop. Long time ASUS customer, but their products have become extremely low quality and the support given is next to none. Too bad these issues started happening after my return window because Amazon will no longer take it back for a refund, and ASUS only offers a repair/replacement, both of which I am not fond of.

I plan to pick up an additional 2tb internal drive for another $80 or so bucks. For the price, I think its the only laptop under 1k to have a 4gb 1050 graphics card.

I use it as a remote laptop for events when I am out in the field because everytime I would unplug the other to bring it out it would mess up my audio settings etc. So I bought a 2nd one having had no problems with the first...As soon as I bought this thing I have had issues. For one, the computer WILL NOT TURN ON without being plugged in. If it is plugged in, it starts up fine. And yes the battery is fully charged etc, at least I think it is as it wont turn on without its power plug. But I have had it at 100% from the beginning.. Anyway.2nd issue. When I go to type in my password to start the computer the letters never show up. I just ghost type it now and it starts but it is annoying that the dots wont show up to acknowledge that it is registering letters. You usually know things are set to go when you see the cursor and the text input so its just annoying to not have that.3rd issue. It is slow as molasses! I was thinking maybe I installed something that messed it all up but from reading the other reviews, that is probably not the case. Ugh. And there is so much storage space left on it so I know that is not it. I literally dont keep any music, photos or anything like that on it to make sure it runs smooth for broadcasts (I do the same with the other PC) and it is still slow from the beginning.4th issue. I feel like everytime I turn the damn thing on its ""installing updates, please do not turn off the computer"" or something like that. Very frustrating when you need to turn on your computer and get right to work.Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because when it's working, it works well! But there are just some really annoying problems that make me want to throw it out a window.I dont know, maybe I will sell this thing and get a better computer soon.",3,2,2,4,2
1033,"Very bright screen - high contrast. Makes a nice gaming computer. Aluminum backing for the screen.Cons: Red LED keyboard.

1036,"I'll admit, I bought this machine fully expecting to return it, and have been pleasantly surprised. I've got enough computers, but the the stylus and promise of Android apps intrigued me so I decided to buy what seemed to be an over-priced chromebook. But what were once billed and priced as semi-disposable laptops have matured into a real PC-killer for most users. I have previously owned Samsung's 11.6"" Chromebook, circa 2013, which was passable as a cheap web browser, but lacked a lot of the quality and functionality present in this latest generation of machines.So far, with 5 days of frequent use, performance has been responsive and snappy. I installed a few of my favorite Android apps, including the ones that inspired the purchase of this computer - Autodesk Sketchbook and Corel Painter Mobile. As a professional artist I can say that both applications perform beautifully on this machine, in part thanks to the screen (which is truly impressive for a laptop at this price point), and of course the included stylus. The concept of mixing web apps and analogous Android apps is pretty confusing, and mostly comes down to preference. Personally I find it's best to use Android versions of apps like Inbox, Calendar, and Twitter while sticking with the more robust web-based versions of Outlook, Docs, and Hangouts.The important take-away here is that many of the gaps in available software that made Chromebooks a dubious purchase in the past have been filled with Android's software library.So who is this computer for? I'd say it's for anyone who is already a user of Android and Chrome who wants to avoid the mess that is Windows. Its construction is solid, and the hardware feels good. The keyboard is much better than you'd expect, as is the track pad. The addition of the touchscreen and stylus make this a very versatile device, and one that has won me over. It won't replace my MacBook Pro (there's no replacing the Adobe Suite), but it will fit on an airplane tray table with room to spare and get me by while commuting on a train or sitting in the coffee shop.",2,4,5,4,5

I figured that if it wasn't enough i could always return it. but fortunately the laptop is holding its own. However I wouldn't recommend for video editing. Other features I really like on this are the Windows Hello feature. It works insanely well. Also, the track pad is amazing! The best I've ever seen on a PC. I didn't give windows 10 S a chance so I can't review that. The first thing I did was upgrade to Windows 10 Pro.

The charger cable, a Dell Charger cable, does not read properly so I am consistently getting messages saying that it is not charging my battery.

1046,So far so good. A lot of updates and over a fast connection approximately 3 hours of initial install. Backup recovery takes awhile too. Some bloat ware to remove. Easy to get fingerprints on keyboard area. Since HD is a hybrid really have to be careful about where to install/load data. The master OS will be full pretty quickly so remove old windows install files ASAP.Runs good but highly recommended adding the 8 ram from the start.

(I did not review to see if a longer size was available.)-The battery seems to be a good battery, however when the computer is not on battery save mode, it tends to die quick.-While on Battery save mode, the screen seems to be darker than what would be requested of our norm. (This could be a personal preference.)Overall, I highly recommend this computer. We are a MAC family and tend to steer away from other products.

The unit I have got delivered with a keyboard that is somewhat (by atleast 1 mm) recessed into the chassis near the D-F-G-V keys owing to the aluminum chassis having bent.The coil whine problem is not that serious on my unit, but to pay a $1,000 to have a notebook delivered with a bent chassis has been disappointing to say the least.",3,2,2,0,3

1080,"Great little laptop for the price. I bought this to replace an older, aging Asus ROG laptop and I absolutely love using it! It starts up fast, plays all my games great, and is nearly half the weight of my old gaming laptop! The fingerprint scanner works every time and is a much appreciated addition to the computer. The keyboard deck is a firm aluminum, which makes typing and using the laptop in normal use feel very premium, despite the rest of the chassis being made of plastic, though the plastic certainly does not feel cheap. The computer has a very professional look to it with a hint of that gamer charm in the red accents and keyboard. I personally find it to be a very tasteful and minimalist design, as opposed to the more flashy gaming laptops on the market, though others may disagree.The screen is great for most uses, however it can seem a bit washed out in some areas and when it goes black you can see some backlight bleed around the camera. Other than that, it works just fine for everyday use and gaming, and I don't have any issues with viewing angles. Speaking of angles, however, the screen does not bend back very far. For use on a desk or table this won't be too much of an issue, but on your lap or propped up against your knees while laying down in bed, this can present some awkward viewing positions where you're looking above the screen, rather than directly at it. I don't have a huge issue with this, but others might.The keyboard feels very tactile and easy to type on. Keystrokes are smooth and consistent and the WASD keys have a nice outline to them, further accenting the gaming aspects of this laptop. The keys seem to have a bit of a hollow, plasticky feel to them, but this does not detract from the experience unless you're the nitpicky type. I have not had any issues using this keyboard thus far.The trackpad could be better, but it's not horrible. I was a little spoiled to the higher end trackpad of my ROG with the smooth glass feel, so coming to the textured plastic feel of this Inspiron is different. Precision is rather good and gestures work with no issues.As far as sound is concerned the computer is silent during light use, such as web browsing and even watching YouTube. When I played Metal Gear Solid V, the fans kicked in but were not that loud or distracting. However, jumping over to PUBG, the fans went into overdrive, presumably because that game is much more processing intensive. You'll want to invest in a good set of headphones if you don't like to hear fans mixed in with your game sound.Speaking of sound, the internal speakers are good for the price point. They are not the best and a better set of external speakers or a good set of headphones will be much better. The internal speakers, even maxed out, seem a little quiet. For normal use they'll get the job done, but you'll probably want headphones of your own.The GeForce GTX1060 6GB packed into this machine has played whatever game I throw at it, from Fallout 4 to PUBG, at a consistent 60 frames per second. Even on battery the laptop can handle gaming, if at lower graphics settings and for a rather short 1 hour of playtime. Like any gaming laptop, you'll want to keep this one plugged in to play. Battery life, otherwise, has been hovering around 4-5 hours before needing a charge, a marked improvement for me over my ROG, which could barely hold 2 hours before dying.TL;DR: You're not going to find another laptop at this price point that delivers what this one does. I paid $899 for mine, the other laptop I was looking at was the Acer Predator Helios 300, which packs a more powerful processor but does not have the SSD and HDD included, only the SSD. I would have had to pay another $50-60 for an additional HDD, along with the $1000 price tag of the Helios. This Dell saved me nearly $200 and delivers all the performance I need without needing to buy more stuff along with it. If you're looking for a gaming laptop that won't break the bank while delivering excellent performance, this is the one to get.",1,0,5,2,2

1083,"Let me start off by saying that I did a lot of research into this model before deciding to buy, so I have no idea why other reviews are complaining about features not included. I strongly considered the Dell XPS 13 and similar ultrabooks in this price/feature range. I decided to go with the gram for a number of reasons, which include the ability to add RAM and storage.I have had it for a few days and I am extremely impressed with what LG has done with the latest version of the gram. After seeing previous models and having one or two things that really turned me off (the camera located by the hinge), I am thrilled to see that LG listened to customer feedback and made changes.The 8th generation i5 has proven quite fast and I have not had any issues with any of what I have thrown at it. Battery life is excellent, but I have not put the 22 hours to the test yet. I am currently on battery saver and at 75% remaining it says I have 17 hours and 25 minutes left. The fan isnt silent on load but it isnt crazy loud either  I would classify it as normal. I do like that the fan vent openings face to the rear of the computer (see video) instead of facing down. This allows it to stay cooler when it is being used on your lap, the air can escape.The fit and form of the laptop is top notch. It does not feel flimsy or cheap and does not flex or bend. I do not think that there will be any issues, it feels sturdy and well-made. The screen is sharp, clear, and plenty bright. I really like the keyboard and the touchpad. I think LG did a great job with the keys, they have just the right amount of travel. I would call the touchpad good, I have not had any issues with it so far. I also like the Fn buttons, particularly the keyboard backlight, touchpad on/off, and reader mode (reduces blue light).Unfortunately, the Windows 10 it came with had all kinds of bloatware. I attached the screenshot of the used space on the hard drive when I received it (35.6 GB) and when I formatted and put a fresh install of Windows 10 Home back on and added the LG drivers/software from the website (16.8 GB). The difference is crazy, I would recommend that everyone wipe their systems, reinstall Windows, and download the LG software. It saves a ton of space and give you a lot more control of what is on your system. This isnt just advice for this particular laptop, but really any computer you buy these days.I did not want a fingerprint reader, I did not want an i7, I did not want a touchscreen. I wanted a fast, 8th generation, extremely portable computer for grad school and everything that comes with that (video chat, internet use, writing, etc.). I also wanted the longest possible battery life  which is why this model is perfect for me. So far it has delivered and I am extremely pleased with the new gram.I will update this review if anything changes.Pros:It is extremely lightUpgradeableIt is a great looking computerThe keyboard and touchpad are fantasticCons:No Fn key on the right side of the keyboard (personal preference)No Thunderbolt 3Bloatware (which all companies do these days)",3,2,3,2,4

Then there is the fact that Windows 10 is loaded with bloatware you can't uninstall or even disable, all kinds of subscription ""services"" that just cost you money--including the formerly free games like freecell & solitaire, it collects all kinds of information whether you want it to or not, which you can limit somewhat but not eliminate, & generally just insists on running your computer however it wants to regardless of anything you might want or need.",3,3,3,2,4

The response time in order to open up applications and programs, even a web browser, let alone Youtube videos too take more than an actual minute.I am very disappointed",2,4,1,2,2

1117,"The good thing about this machine is that it looks like most full-size laptops, though has the advantage that is pretty light. The bad thing here is that it is really limited, with pretty minimal (32 GB) storage and not a whole lot of processing power. Having said that, it is a good computer if you basically want a machine for web browsing - You can add in Microsoft Office (for $100+), though I don't know how well it would run.The screen is pretty good sized and I would say the colors are fair, with pretty good definition. The sound is OK, but nothing to rave about. There is an external speaker jack and 3 USB ports. I suppose you could hook in a small set of speakers or use headphones with the computer. I did play a ""mov"" with the computer and after taking about 10 seconds to start, played well. Screen is pretty bright and computer seems to go about 8 hours on a single charge.Having said all of this, remember this is a computer for $200. I see it as a good spare computer to use for web browsing and to give to kids to use. It is OK for what it is, but I would wonder if you could spend one or two hundred dollars more and get a computer with significantly more capability. Having said that the one gives you basic functionality at a very reasonable price.",3,4,5,4,3

1122,"This is a great basic ""no frills"" laptop, it has everything you need and want for everyday emailing, watching videos schoolwork etc..It even has a dvd drive which is becoming increasingly rare these days! BTW, if you like to watch videos the battery will give you about 5 hours of movies. For normal browsing, emailing etc... you get close to 7 hours of use which is good, imo and the screen is nice and crisp for watching videos.With the 128 gb drive being a solid state drive it is MUCH faster than the average basic laptop so that is a nice upgrade from a basic slow 5400 rpm drive. This can be upgraded with more ram and a larger drive but this is not designed for gaming so the 128gb ssd it comes with should work fine for the average person/student or light business user. I would rather it be a 256gb ssd (who wouldn't?) but that is why this is lower priced, the more you add upgrades the more it would/will cost! So you need to decide do you want an efficient basic laptop for everyday use or one that costs more with all the bells and whistles?I am rating this on what it comes with and how well it performs. If you want a higher end laptop this is not the one for you!I have large hands and the keyboard fits comfortably into daily use, now it will never compare to a full size keyboard that you use with a PC but as far as laptops go it is nice, the keys are low profile but you definitely can feel the click of your typing action. Easy to transport as it weighs in at just under 5 pounds. The case is nice and sturdy with a matte finish that resists fingerprints which is nice also.",2,2,4,4,2

The real test is when you are using Google Docs and Office 365 these are the most intensive apps for Chromebooks and this thing handles both extremely well! I've triedmany android apps, multi windows, multiple apps and the SCP handles them like a champ! Also It has a very streamlined look and it's super slim and light.One last thing; some people have been complaining that this chromebook does not have a backlit keyboard like another comparable chromebook and here's the deal: the screen brightness on the SCP is much brighter than others thus you can see the lettering on the keys in complete darkness so it's not needed. Other chromebooks on the market do not have comparable brightness to the SCP so they have/should incorporate backlit keyboards.Again kudos to Samsung for making another great product!I definitely would not pay $549 for the pro; I believe this is all the power you need in a Cromebook for what they do right now.Update: 2/22/2017: Since launch this has been my usage: office 365 a photo editing app, outlook mail app and chrome remote desktop for work along with 12 open tabs daily and the SCP is handling all that extremely well!",2,4,5,4,5

1140,"Acer Predator 17 Gaming Laptop, Core i7, GeForce GTX 1070, 17.3"" Full HD G-SYNC, 16GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD, G9-793-79V5The Acer Predator G9-793-79V5 is probably the best choice I made for a gaming laptop, I really was tempted to get an Asus ROG but after checking the specs between them I believe this one convinced me. Will try to be as detailed as possible.* THE GOOD:+ 17"" diagonal LCD IPS screen providing native 1920x1080 resolution.+ nVidia GTX 1070 graphics.+ Illuminated keyboard + keypad.+ Hotkey / macro profiles on the left side, switch button allows to store up to 15 macros+ OS very clean, not a lot of bloatware to complain of and the Acer utilities include a wi-fi analyzer which in turn allows to configure better wi-fi channels for better network performance.+ 2x128Gb M.2 (B+M) key SSD + 1Tb 7200 SATA HD.+ 16Gb RAM out of the box plus 2 easy access slots on the back for expansion.+ USB 3.0 ports layout is good, not spread all over and spaced nicely to connect multiple devices without blocking each other.* THE BAD:- Heavy and large but again its 17"" made for gaming or to replace a desktop so deal with it.- Proper gaming sessions require power brick connected, power brick rated for 230W output.- Quick start guide very simple instructions, you actually need to download the manual to learn most of its tricks.- 2x128Gb M.2 (B+M) key in RAID-0 configuration. (Read below)- Locked ""InsydeH20"" BIOS. (Read below)- Basic optical media, DVD reader / writer, my previous computer was an HP Pavilion dv6 and could read Blu-Ray discs.Let me give you my biggest beefs to a couple of the ""BAD"" things.* Having 2 SSD drives is a big bonus, but using them in a RAID-0 array its pointless, because they are SSD's, they are fast already and the RAID-0 gain in so minimal that the computer actually wastes time writing on 2 devices instead of 1.* This problem with RAID 0 is compounded due the fact that Acer decided to lock the BIOS so the SATA mode is set to RAID and preventing end users to change it. Again this is a major mistake. In the event of RAID array failure the user cannot reinstall software or may not recover at all since the configuration setting is locked.At this point some of you who know how to work with RAID-0 arrays may think. ""Surely that kind of problem is very rare.""Sadly it is not, before this review I received this same computer and while running it through its paces the RAID array failed.Because RAID was locked in BIOS I could not use an image I made at first and the Acer recovery tools and recovery management were unable to reinstall the software or rebuild the array from scratch.This also prevents users from upgrading to bigger SSD drive sizes, I am unaware of the RAID array will be rebuilt on a bigger SSD drive, plus the SSD slots and space for them may cause problem installing a new SSD. (See pictures)Acer really needs to unlock the BIOS and give the option to the users to configure the computer as they see fit and its not really that hard. After speaking with Acer support he claimed that users can unlock the BIOS but its not Acer's policy to disclose how to do it. So I assume the unlock procedure is just a backdoor or master password to unlock all features.Now a bit on the good side:This is a laptop computer but you want to use it on a table for comfort, when its running at full speed it gets warm BUT the lap portion remains relatively cool. Using the overclocking options the most heat came from the rear away from the lap and even away from the keyboard, even graphic-intensive games were run very smoothly at ""Ultra"" settingsIn the end I think the GOOD overcome the BAD and its a solid purchase for both work and entertainment for the next couple years and if Acer stops trying to tie leashes on the customers it will be a great purchase for everyone else.** 08/12/2017 A bit of more updates. **Around 1 month after I got the computer have used it to convert movies with handbrake and while all 4 cores work at full I see no extra heat coming out from the back, heat output remains at a steady 97F-98F.While people like to use test programs like heaven and others I prefer to use somewhat intensive applications.I run Second life at Ultra settings and Space Engineers online and they both run quite smoothly, very little (if any) visual lag.The most delays I notice is when using the SATA hard drive for the programs but using the SSD's pretty much prevents that.Still trying to get ACER to spit the BIOS backdoor/master password to unlock all features but no success so far.** 08/22/2017 More updates. **With the help from ACER predator forums I learned I could update from the 2x128Gb RAID-0 to a single 512Gb NVMe M.2 stick by removing both SSD's and placing the new one then restore a full backup upon the new drive so as not lose any existing data. (No need to make changes to BIOS except boot order)The process took 2 or 3 tries before getting it right but it worked, with the single NVMe drive the predator is not just fast.It flies!Loading time from Power-Up to Windows 10 login is 7 seconds flat.Afterwards I connected one of the remaining 128Gb sticks to the M.2 SATA connector and using Inter Rapid Storage GUI inside windows broke its RAID setting so I can use it instead to install programs on it.So now I have 3 drives:1x512Gb NVMe M.2 SSD stick.1x128Gb SATA M.2 SSD stick1x1Tb SATA 7200 HD.",2,0,1,0,1

As a small nonprofit I was looking for something that was not to expensive but would handle daily use for Microsoft Offiice, Quickbooks, and our online data entry service. There are two issues I continually have with this laptop and that is the screen/mouse will start jumping to different screens in the middle of working on something else and the internet will drop making me reboot the computer to get it back.For the screen issue - the mouse will move around on it's own and then the screen will show all the different programs I have open, i.e. word, excel, internet, etc. It does not matter if it is 2 or 5 programs. It is really irritating when you are in the middle of typing and it switches screens. There is no rhyme or reason to when it happens.The second issue is the internet/wifi will drop or not start up. The only way to get it to start again is to restart the computer. Sometimes when traveling for work, it will not connect to the wifi at a hotel.However, for the price it is a reasonable laptop which I have been using for a year now.

Searched the internet and found out that this is a recurring issue with ASUS (look up You Tube). Spent about 30 minutes to an hour with technical assistance at Amazon and could get nothing to work. Returned for a better machine. Seriously, we turned on and used the machine three times before the screen issue. Will not purchase and ASUS again.",2,2,1,2,2
1158,"After reading numerous reviews between this, a comparable Lenovo, and the HP Stream 11, I bought the ASUS.I own both a high-end ASUS desktop machine, and also an early 2016 ASUS UX305 laptop. Both are great machines, and I put them through the grind on a daily basis. That said, I'm not ""brand loyal"" by any stretch of the imagination.I came to Amazon via a PC Magazine breakdown of the best budget laptops for 2017. I was intentionally looking for a full Windows 10 laptop in the smallest weight and physical size footprint I could get, for the least amount of money. I knew I didn't want a Chromebook, but wanted the cheapest step up from that which I could. The reason for this has to do with some of the places I travel to, both domestically (USA) and internationally. Basically, I wanted something bare bones that I could use Word, Excel, and PowerPoint from, send email, and write blog posts, but that was cheap enough that I wouldn't cry if it was either stolen on a train in Europe (been there, done that) or demolished by a 70-foot drop down a ravine.Even though the specs on this computer are slightly lower than both the Lenovo and HP Stream I was looking at, I opted for this machine based solely on physical size and weight. It's just a smidge under 1kg, and had the smallest physical dimensions.Received it today and immediately went to work on uninstalling the bloatware and disabling as much of the Windows 10 junk as possible. If you are not tech savvy, there are a number of tools that will help you with this process. I personally used the Winaero Tweaker to get rid of most of the Microsoft spyware and other stuff. Despite my dislike of the new Office 365 system, I went ahead and activated the complimentary 1 year Office 365 membership -- a nice perk that would normally cost $70 (thus making this a $130 laptop, if you squint real hard).With a dozen Chrome tabs open, another application installing, and a giant update downloading all at the same time... Sure, it slows to a crawl. But it was tolerable. Mine was manufactured in April 2017 (mfg date is on the sticker on the bottom of the unit), and I doubt I would have been as thrilled with the early 2016 version that only had 2 GB of RAM and a slightly older processor.Sure, the screen ain't the best, and it will grind to a halt if you try doing audio or video editing probably, but that's not what it's for. My ASUS UX305 with an Intel i-5 processor does near real-time video rendering -- this E200HA ain't going to do that, and I would never ask it to (ok, I'm a nerd, so I might try it just for kicks).For the average home user doing basic word processing and web surfing, this machine is perfectly adequate. I'm a ""power user"" of sorts, and am co-founder of a small tech startup, so know a thing or two about computers even though I'm not an IT professional or ""coder"". This is the machine I would buy if I had a kid at any grade level, including college. It's the laptop I would buy for my mother if, for some reason, she needed something more powerful than her iPad. This is the laptop that I will take with me in the RV and over to Europe over the next few months and not be too worried about it growing legs or falling overboard into the English Channel.It's a great little piece of technology for $200, and will fit the needs of most American consumers. Dial down your expectations, and you won't be disappointed. If you simply need more horsepower, then I'd suggest looking at the current ASUS line in the $600-$800 price range, because that's what you'll need to spend for far superior performance.",3,1,5,4,3
1159,"We had to purchase this item three times before we got one that worked. Laptop would hibernate and couldn't be waked up without rebooting and loosing our work.

The only problem I have is that it is super slow when on battery at times. I get that it would not be as fast while playing games on the battery, but just surfing the internet or watching videos, I can notice it slowing down quite a bit more than it should. Its not unbearable, but it is noticiable, enough that it is slightly irritating at times.Even with that slight issue, it is well worth it. If you plan to use this while plugged in 100% (or majority of the time while using it), you will have no issue, and if you don't, you will see it be slower than it can be (though if you plan to get a gaming computer and can't keep it plugged in while playing, you're going to have issues with ANY laptop).",1,0,5,2,2

I was in the very same position you are in right now but only a few days ago. Coming from an Intel Core i3 DESKTOP, this laptop has proven to be everything and anything I would want for a laptop at this price point.

1173,Good but could do better. The ChromeOS is constantly evolving which is great and the app store means there is really no need for android tablets anymore. My only complaint would be the cramp cheap feeling keyboard and track pad. The lack of back lighting is not usually an issue as the letters are reflective and the amazing screen illuminates them. Google play out of the box is a welcome addition to ChromeOS and i found it worked well. I didn't notice too many laggy moments apart from under heavy work load with multiple apps and tabs open. The op1 SOC works very well for everyday tasks. I haven't ran and MS office apps on this yet so can't comment.

1176,"I've had an ASUS Zenbook for about a year and a halfASUS ZenBook UX303UA 13.3-Inch FHD Touchscreen Laptop, Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 10 (64 bit)That I've really liked and been happy with. It's smaller than this ASUS laptop, but has similar specs for processor and RAM power. My Zenbook was my first laptop with a SSD drive instead of a hard-drive, and while I do really like it and am happy with it, I'm always worried I'll use up all the space on the SSD and so I end up relying on Microsoft cloud storage much more than I'd like to. I saw this ASUS with a 1 TB hard drive - which is pretty huge - and decided to snap it up. We're using it as our ""family"" computer, and sort of the central repository for documents, photos, etc. We use it directly, but also access it via our home network for stuff. It's easy to work with and so far seeming to be a really nice laptop. A few years ago I avoided ASUS, thinking they were crappy despite the many good reviews. However, I've since changed my opinion and have become a big ASUS fan, with now 2 ASUS computers and 3 ASUS zenfones. So, here's why I've had a change of heart along with my review which leans heavily on comparing this laptop with my ASUS Zenbook.....My history with ASUS and why I went from hating them to loving them:Originally, way back when, my husband had a couple of ASUS computers and I thought they were crappy because he went through two of them within a years time as they'd always malfunction. Well, we realized it's him - seriously! - there's something about him and the windows platform that doesn't work well together and he seems to just kill all his microsoft computers (even his work issued Dell dies and malfunctions constantly when he has to work from home). For home use he switched to a Mac (which I despise, but to each his own...) and he's been a happy camper for 3 years now - a record for him!Meanwhile, a little over a year and a half ago I nervously bought an ASUS Zenbook after having disappointing performance & two BUS replacements due to factory build issues on a thinkpad within a year of (very expensive) purchase, followed by repeated fan failure on an HP after only 2 months (the HP was supposed to be the replacement for the crappy thinkpad). I then sought out what had the best reviews for a small, lightweight laptop that also had strong performance and reliability, and at that time the ASUS kept coming up again and again, with the Zenbook being their smallest/lightest version. The Zenbook has been great, much more hearty and stable than all my various past laptops, and is able to handle the 100+ tabs I often have open in my browser when researching (I kid you not, the last onetab app gathering up of tabs I had 181 open tabs, plus MSword open, pdf reader open and it was running fine and dandy!). I even ended up getting 3 ASUS zenphones because of my positive experience - and we love those as well! We have twoAsus ZenFone 3 ZE520KL Unlocked Dual Sim Phone, 32GB, 5.2-inch, 3GB RAM, No Warranty - International Version (Moonlight White)and one deluxeASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe 5.7-inch AMOLED FHD display, 6GB RAM 64GB storage Unlocked Dual SIM Cell Phone, US Warranty (ZS570KL-Glacier Silver)(I have the deluxe and love, love, love it!). Anyways, the point is I'm now a fully on board ASUS fan having had no problems and superior performance on all my ASUS devices over the past couple of years.THIS particular ASUS laptop:We wanted something we could store our many digital images and documents on, so something with a big hard drive (yes, I know I can just get an external hard drive for that - and we do have a few - but we wanted a laptop with a big drive built in and all the other performance features I've come to expect from my Zenbook). This met the criteria with the large drive, plus it has the same RAM and processor I've got in my Zenbook. My Zenbook has touch screen and this does not, but in the grand scheme of things I really don't use my touchscreen all that much. This has a long battery life, just like my Zenbook - unlike many computers that report a long battery life but in reality drain quickly, I've found my Zenbook to really and truly have a long battery life & so far this one has a similar reliability, although we don't use it on battery all that much. This is bigger, 15.6"" vs 13.3"" and 2lbs heavier than my Zenbook but still pretty lightweight for a bigger laptop & can easily be transported around. Should my Zenbook die (please say no) I'd have no issues taking this laptop on an airplane with me on a trip.This has TPM security & I honestly don't know what that is so I can't comment on that. It also has a fingerprint reader, and like the one on my Zenfone it works pretty well (wet fingers are the only time I find a challenge, so I have to do an extra drying after washing hands, etc. if I want it to read my print). The wifi connection and speed seems no different between this and my Zenbook and both clock the same speeds on our internet connection. I will say it doesn't start up instantly like my Zenbook does, but I think that's related to having a SSD drive vs a hard drive, as I believe that is a benefit to an SSD drive. However, it's not like it takes a prolonged amount of time to start up - for a laptop with a hard drive I believe it's where it should be.Special features of this laptop:There are special features on this computer since it's marketed as a ""business"" laptop. You can wake it over a network (something I'm not likely to do & haven't used so can't speak to this), and it has an easily accessed inside so that you can upgrade RAM. The battery is removable - something that used to be standard with most laptops and is now rare. I suppose if you travel it may be helpful to have an extra and swap it out? This, again, is a feature I don't really need or use. There is also an additional ""business"" app that ASUS put on there that's supposed to help when using this as a business laptop - I don't use this. I think generally heavy business users are more productive on systems that are faster and more powerful (the processor and RAM) and that's most of why they're calling this a business laptop. However, unless you solely read email and surf the internet I think those are important features for most users and allow the flexibility to use it for most anything you might want. I think that also makes it possibly a good computer for entry level gamers, too.Possible use for gaming??My daughter has an Alienware, which is optimized for gaming. Gaming is intense on your onboard systems and so need stronger computers to handle them well. I don't do the super action games, but my zenbook and this laptop can handle Sims4 7 minecraft on the high quality/high definition graphics & screen resolution without stuttering or issues. However, when compared to what it looks like on my daughter's Alienware hers is absolutely much more crisp, clear and defined (part of this is her screen is also higher resolution even though my computer is high definition), and she has special memory and drivers allocated to graphics. However, I don't know how well this or my Zenbook would do on Overwatch and other fast moving online gaming platforms. BUT! Before she had her Alienware she was able to play Overwatch on a computer that had similar specs to what my Zenbook has, just at lower graphics. This makes me think that this laptop *might* be a good, low cost option for gaming for an entry level gamer - especially since it's easy to access the innards and upgrade RAM. Something to consider for those who aren't willing to fork out the big $$$ for expensive gaming laptops (although I will say we initially weren't willing to spend the money, but eventually we caved and bought the Alienware for our daughter and she definitely has less power issues, better graphics and better timing responses when gaming while also being able to use it for school and everything else needed...).For StudentsThis is a great option for students, esp. college students for a low cost yet powerful laptop that can handle most anything they need. There is plenty of room for tons of documents (reports, class notes, downloaded documents, etc.) and it can handle having multitudes of tabs open for students who are doing a lot of research online. It also easily handles having several applications open at once along with the multiple tabs (Typically I'll have Word, Powerpoint, PDF reader, File explorer, and my browser with at least 30+ tabs open at once - and often two browsers, chrome and firefox, all at the same time. I teach online & do a lot of course and assignment creation, thus the many programs all open at once. As mentioned above, it also handles some gaming, although they may need to optimize it by adding stuff for fast paced gaming like Overwatch and FPS games.Lastly, from experience a few years back, when my husband kept killing his ASUS computers and I thought they were crappy - the customer service for repairs was good and sending in computers for repairs had a quick turn-around (under 2 weeks including mailing time both ways). However, we live in the SF Bay area and for us the repair center was also in the SF Bay area - perhaps it would be longer for folks who aren't so close to an ASUS repair center.SUMMARY: Nice, powerful, easy to use yet inexpensive laptop from a company that has demonstrated solid, reliable computers & phones. Great for Business users, students, and anyone wanting a fast & powerful laptop at a low cost. Reccommended.",2,2,1,2,2

1180,"A long story on this purchase.I originally bought a different notebook as a gift for my mother. ( I know it says laptop, but I consider it more of a notebook). My son and I looked at a lot of different notebooks and finally decided on an Acer Chromebook. My son is very familiar with computers, laptops and notebooks (has a computer science degree) so he was shocked when he found out it did not allow him to install icons on the desktop. The icons all were on the bottom of the computer. My mother is ninety-years-old and wanted her notebook to look just like her computer. So we looked again and bought this one for her. Just yesterday my mother mentioned she really loves it.. She works on a lot of crossword puzzles and normally would get up and look up a clue on her computer if she was stumped. Now she has the notebook right next to her on the couch. If she is watching a show and something piques her curiosity she can look it up while still watching the show. My son set it up with the same programs as her computer with all the similar icons and she says it is very easy to use. Now I am not criticizing the Chromebook, but we were all surprised when we saw it. This Laptop (Notebook?) was a great purchase.",3,2,5,4,6

1185,"Right off let me say I'm really impressed with this laptop. Here are my thoughts:FORM FACTOR: This laptop is intended for gaming, so while it's definitely portable it's bigger and heavier than a general-use laptop. The case is really attractive; I love the brushed-aluminum look, and the unit overall looks sharp and slightly aggressive without looking gaudy, although the case does attract fingerprints. Overall the unit feels solid and well built.DISPLAY: I really like the display. Despite being an IPS display the color and clarity looked great to me, although you do need to view the screen from directly in front for best quality. The screen size and resolution are absolutely perfect; it's nice and sharp with great pixel density but not so much that you have to use Windows' clunky scaling feature.KEYBOARD: The keyboard is not bad. Key travel is good and it was comfortable to type on. I like that it has a keypad. The one thing I didn't like is that the keys are black with dark-red lettering. This is fine with the keyboard backlight is on, but if you're running on battery and the backlight is off it's nearly impossible to see what's printed on the keys. This can be a problem even if you know your way around a keyboard since a lot of the keys are smaller and closer-spaced than a full-size keyboard.TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is what I would call middle of the road. Not great but it gets the job done. If you're going to be doing any kind of gaming you should absolutely have an external mouse.SOUND: The audio is the one thing that really surprised me--it's fantastic, the best I've ever heard from a laptop, and even better than some desktop speakers I've used. The sound is nice and full and doesn't have that thin ""AM radio"" sound that a lot of laptops have. The stereo separation when you're sitting in front of the computer is terrific as well.PERFORMANCE: I knew the specs were pretty good before using the laptop and it didn't disappoint. I was able to run a bunch of my favorite games just fine, including some CPU/GPU intensive ones. As long as you're not the kind of person that needs to have every graphics-quality slider at maximum this laptop gets the job done. I will say when the computer is running full tilt the case fan spins like crazy and is quite loud, but this is pretty typical for laptops. When the computer is not running full tilt it's fairly quiet.CONCLUSION: This is a great budget gaming laptop and represents a fantastic value. It feels solid and well built, looks nice, and performs great for gaming on a budget.",2,0,3,2,2
1186,"One of the reasons I bought this computer was that it said it had good wifi connectivity - total rubbish, it dumps me from my wifi connection many times a day and I am totally annoyed and I think it doesn't deserve any stars. My friend said Lenovo was a good company - more rubbish - I did a search for information on wifi issues and Lenovo and there are lots of pages about how this has been their issue for years - yes they give you some things to try to see if they help, but why can't they fix the problem before they ship the computers to retailers - WHY is it still a problem years later that must be fixed by the buyer!!!!

1202,"I bought this laptop to decommission a Dall unit from 2012 which served me very well, also being a 15.6 inch. It was pretty difficult trying to find an all around good laptop that fit all my criteria but this one mostly does it all.Build - 80% of the body is a light sturdy plastic. The cover on the screen lid is a metal sheet that makes the lid pretty sturdy. I like the weight of it and it doesn't seem flimsy at all. It looks great and premium has a good selection of ports and a full size SD slot.Screen - I came from a 768p laptop which was the worst, so jumping to 1080p is an irreversible step I've taken. It's very vivid and colors aren't too saturated. The brightness is on the low side and would be nice if it could get about 20% brighter and it is a matte finish and gives very decent angles.Battery - My laptop is usually a desk queen, but I have tested the battery and it's decent. Light use would see about 6 hours of life and hard use would be closer to ~2 hours. The battery time estimate is erratic and sometimes seems inaccurate.Keyboard & Touchpad - So I was expecting to have to relearn a new keyboard but I guess since the main body is only slightly smaller than my last laptop so it's almost basically all the same spacing and everything. There is no function key lock which I seemed to take for granted previously but it's not a big deal. This keyboard is backlit and has 3 different levels of brightness, brightness 1 is enough for me so +1 to that. The keys aren't loose and typing on them is I think satisfying, they're somewhat quiet when pushed. People complain about how the power button is right next to the delete key, but for me personally I don't find this an issue at all.So the touch pad isn't good, your fingers don't slide over it easily, it grabs your finger basically.. really odd. It clicks great, but I won't be trying to use is at all. Would recommend a bluetooth mouse at all times. The fingerprint reader hasn't failed once.Processor & Speed - My model is the i7 7500U... It's basically an i5 7200U but with a .2Ghz quicker clock speed. Still dual core (bummer... thanks intel) and turbo boosts to 3.48Ghz. My base clock speed according to windows and also Intel's own driver software says 2.9Ghz. I wish I had gotten a model with an actual i7 instead of an i5 with an i7 badge. Fan noise is overall quiet until you run something that puts it at over 50% CPU usage but even still, it's manageable. Keep your power settings to 'Recommended' because 'High Performance' keeps it permanently turboboosted @ 3.48Ghz **The model with dedicated graphics would be worth it if you're more than a less than casual gamer.Wireless - Bluetooth is quick to reconnect a mouse when turning on the laptop. At the same spot my last laptop was, this one gets 'excellent' signal whereas my other one would get 'fair' to the sometimes 'good'.Speakers & Sound - So out of the box it doesn't sound good, neither do. You'll need to play music and then adjust the EQ to make it sound nice, but when you do it sounds as good as you can make it. My previous Dell laptop has the best speakers and the best EQ settings for headphones/speakers I've ever heard so I had to make lots of adjustments through the EQ of this laptop to make it sound as close as I can as my last computer. I got it pretty close but still not perfect, but I can live with it! The weird this is this computer comes with like 3 programs that control EQ which is very confusing, AND they all aren't mutually exclusive so they all build on each other. For this reason I recommend doing it though the 'ICEpower Audiowizard' program.",1,2,1,2,3

Who knows what is vital and what is expendable? I finally decided (after zillions of annoying messages from the dreaded Micro$oft) to buy a new computer with more memory.

I had a few dollars laying around and decided I was tired of its computing power (or lack of) and determined it was time to invest in something new. Of course by default, I started investigating new iPads. Brainwashed! It dawned on me that perhaps I needed to look into some alternate makes/models. I should add that I use my iPad the way that most people do I presume: watching YouTube, looking things up in Google's search engine and occasionally using Google's cloud based suite of apps (Docs, Sheets and Slides).

I have thought about getting a detachable keyboard for the iPad in the past but decided it was kind of crazy to add a peripheral to a tablet, which was as large as the device itself.So I started looking into other devices and I came over to Chromebooks. Well let's fast forward because you all know what I ended up buying. I can say now after taking this on many trips, using it in airports, hotels and even on planes, that I absolutely love it. I laugh at the criticisms that people are giving this hardware here in other reviews, as they obviously should have bought something totally different. You don't buy a Ford Taurus and then complain that it doesn't go 120mph or ask questions like 'does it come with a spoler?'. The Taurus does not come with a spoiler, but it will get you to work everyday and then some, and you can put 200,000 miles on it. See where I am going with this?First of all, there should be almost no reason to ever install any apps on this thing. I don't play games on my phone or on my old iPad so I don't care about that. Even YouTube, the app offers nothing over the regular website in Chrome. I have installed nothing. The Google suite of 'Office' products previously mentioned also work totally fine running from the cloud. Why do you need hard drive space on this device? Use Google Drive. I have put it in convertible mode (flipped backwards like a tent) and sat in Starbucks for hours watching YouTube. I can type probably 90% of my normal ~70wpm on this tiny keyboard. I can write extensive well written emails and work on reports, spreadsheets, presentations, etc... with this awesome device. I must admit it is a little odd using it as a tablet, perhaps because it is so large (this seemed awesome on paper before I got it), and feeling the keyboard underneath seems wrong. But I think these things are in my head. You don't need RAM, or hard drive space, or USB ports, or a DVD drive. If you need those things, it is easy enough to get a decent laptop for the same price as this. What this offers that a laptop does not is extemely small footprint, low weight, great form factor, and something that is built to interface flawlessly with Google's cloud products. I am a dyed in the wool Google user so this was a perfect fit for me. If you reject their products I suppose you could use Office 365 products fairly well as those also operate in the cloud.This thing boots up in about 3 seconds. I already use Chrome on my phone, home desktop and work desktop. So this all makes sense for me. Maybe it doesn't for you. And it certainly doesn't if you want to do video editing or some other high powered stuff, this is a netbook essentially and you don't drive a Ford Taurus if you want to pretend you are in 'The Fast and The Furious'. I am 100% happy with this and I have taken it everywhere with me. Did I mention the battery life is insane? Well it is. I can't say enough about this and I can't believe I lived with an iPad for so many years. I would never ever turn back. That is nothing against Apple, I love my iPhone. Anyway, this is a great device and I suggest you pull the trigger.",2,4,5,4,5
1209,My husband loved this computer and feels it was great for the price. We researched computers for a long time before making this purchase and boy was it worth it.,2,2,1,2,2
1210,"Pros:Very happy overall with this laptop. Excellent performance & built well. Comfortable and responsive keyboard. Keys highly visible in darkness with the red back-lit feature. The display resolution, color, clarity, and brilliance is amazing! This baby can handle existing games at highest settings as well as many of the new titles that are out/will be out. Can't wait to see how it handles Sea of Thieves next month, but based on the recommended game settings from the publisher, it looks like it will handle the game very well at medium to high settings.Cons (Not a big deal though):1. No light indicator to let you know if your Caps, Num or Scroll locks are on or off.2. While gaming, the fan gets pretty loud after a while. Not really an issue if you wear a headset, but keep your left hand away from the exhaust vent. That air blowing out is HOT!Lastly, this is a complaint about Amazon regarding their shipping department. Would it KILL Amazon to use some padding?The laptop arrived in an Amazon box - Which contained the laptop in it's original packaging and a little bit of brown paper. I opened it to find it damaged (Not sure if it was from shipping or from the Manufacturer when packing). Sent it back for a replacement. 2 days later the replacement arrived.....Same kind of Amazon box with the product inside, only this time there was NO PACKING MATERIAL AT ALL. It was just the product box by itself.....Seriously Amazon?Luckily, the replacement was undamaged. As of this review, it's been up and running for 3 and a half days now without problems.First 2 photos are the first laptop that was damaged on arrival. The rest are of the replacement.",2,0,1,2,1

1212,"I've owned this laptop for a week. The laptop is as advertised. The screen display is great, the laptop is very thin and light, easily fits into my bookbag at 15.6"". It came with 128 GB SSD and a 1 TB HDD drive. The Intel Core i5-8250U is awesome; although, I think I would be a little more comfortable with 16 gb of ram and a little more solid state storage (256ish) to make it run just a tad faster, but I can't complain at all for the cost. I haven't done anything too strenuous, but I like to have a little extra room for hardcore multitasking and/or gaming since I'll be starting graduate school in a few days. Windows 10 feels fresh with their updates. Heck, I might even use Edge. Just kidding. I love is the fingerprint scanner. This is my first laptop with a fingerprint scanner, and on this ASUS it's very fast so that is convenient. The laptop has been very quiet, and hasn't heated up on me yet. It feels very nice holding it in my lap because there is plenty of space for the palms of your hands to rest while you type if you're leaning back.The keyboard isn't amazing, and I haven't used the webcam yet. At first, the touchpad was very irritating as it kept flipping on and off, but a quick download of the SmartGesture driver fixed that. The whole touchpad never turns off anymore, but very occasionally I lose capacity to scroll with two fingers, in which cases I have to click the scroll bar to scroll. The speakers on this laptop aren't loud at all at max volume, but that isn't that high of a priority to me, in a few days when I'll be on campus. With any Windows computer I have to delete some unnecessary things before I use though. This one wasn't any different but it didn't take long.All in all, my budget was $800, but I was sold on this $600 computer. To me, with the 8th gen processor and only 3.7 lbs, this was an easy choice if you value portability and performance on a budget. If you don't care about the portability, the Acer Aspire E 15 gives this laptop a very good run for its money at the same price. But at over 5 lbs I had to turn my head.",1,4,1,2,2
1213,"I really love this laptop so far. I have bad luck w/ technology so figures cross. But so far. No problem. I did upgrade to the Windows 10 instead of leaving it for 10s, which gave me more options to utilize. I recommend doing that! This laptop is smooth and fast!",0,2,3,2,4

1215,"I wanted to buy an MSI laptop for a while and after waiting for nearly 2 yrs finally I was able to purchase this beauty.Excellent packaging. Good protection. When I got the laptop for the first time, the screen was defective and Amazon customer service did a fantastic job in not only making sure they arranged for the quick return of the laptop but also ensured replacement was sent in time.Thank you for understanding my plea and for your prompt action.Laptop looks great & it is extremely light (very surprised by this)Processor:-It comes with the i7 7700hq processor. It is fast and provides smooth operation.Backlit keyboard - red color.Keyboard:-The keyboard layout is excellent, well spaced out keys for fast typing.There is a separate number keypad like what you find on normal keyboards for desktop pcs.There are many shortcut keys. Keys feel great while typing.Experienced typists will have a great time typing on this keyboard.The touchpad is very responsive and works very well. You can pinch to zoom or scroll up and down using two fingers.Windows:-It came with Windows 10 home edition. I should have spoken with customer service to get windows 10 pro, don't like home edition at all.Being an IT guy I prefer Windows 10 pro over home edition any day.Battery:-Laptop doesn't get heated up at all. You won't think about it even once. The adapter doesn't get heated up either even after using for long hours. So people who want to use this laptop for long hours, you will love this. I always have the power adapter connected. Battery lasts for 4 hrs - browsing, office work(There is MSI battery software that calibrates the battery, very useful).It was saying 94% plugged in, not charging.I used MSI battery calibration app & overnight it calibrated very well.Now it is showing 100% fully charged. Warning* Do not unplug the charger or use the laptop while this is going on.You will see get this warning even in that app.If you still see this message then drain the battery completelyScreen:-I think the screen is a matte finish. No reflections on the screen & great viewing angles.The 1080p screen is really noticeable. Watching videos or playing games has been a great experience on this laptop. The screen is crystal clear & absolutely gorgeous.Boot time:-Performance - outstanding!!! I am very impressed with fast boot times. 10 seconds to boot up into Windows OS.The laptop is fast and there is no lag whatsoever. Compressing & extracting zip files extremely quickly.Connectivity:-WIFI is excellent, has many options in the settings.Bluetooth connectivity is great. The laptop connects to my Bluetooth speaker pretty quickly and stays connected even after the reboot.4 USB ports. 1 USB 2.0, 1 USB 3.0 and 1 USB 3.1 port along with USB type-c port.Fast data transfer- > It was transferring at 100MB/s speed. Tested it multiple times.128 GB SSD is outstanding, if you have an option go for 256 GB SSD it is really worth the money.There is also 1 TB hard disk for storage. So you have enough space.Wireless Display:-There is Wireless Display option which works really great. This is a huge deal for me because I want to connect to the projector using RKCast and I am extremely happy that it works very well. No lag at all. I played Mortal Kombat XL and didn't notice any lag even with highest settings. Nvidia 1050 totally worth it. But if you are undecided then go for Nvidia GTX 1060 as it supports VR.RAM:-This laptop comes with 8 GB RAM DDR4. The main reason I chose this one because it has the option to upgrade to 32GB in future.Since I didn't have enough money I could afford only 8 GB but if money is not an issue then pick 32 GB. It is totally worth it. Absolutely brilliant performance.Fan noise is very minimal so that is not a problem either because I read many reviews for other laptops (MSI or others) where people complained about laptop fan noise. But that is not a problem at all for this laptop. It is pretty silent and pleasant to use.Camera:-The camera is really good. Press Fn + F6 if you face an issue with camera app on windows. You can take burst shot ( continuous photos) like you can in android phones.Speakers:-Speakers are good, very clear sound, but not comparable to JBL speakers that I used before in my old Dell XPS laptop. They are louder and have good bass. Having said that, I still like the speakers on this laptop. They are not exactly an issue. It will take some time for me to get used to them. But the new buyers can always get great Bluetooth powered speakers for less than 50$ on Amazon.Overall:-I am not deducting any stars for that because the positives in this laptop overshadow everything else.Experience in using this laptop has been outstanding!!!!I totally recommend this laptop to everyone who is looking for a good laptop at a decent price. It is totally worth it whether it is typing documents or running virtual machines or watching videos or playing graphics-intensive games or duplicating the screen to the projector. It does everything flawlessly.I am very impressed. So far I am extremely happy and I hope I don't face any issues or have unpleasant surprises in future.Thank you for reading my review.Update Dec 29th, 2017:-Upgraded my laptop to 32GB after 1 month of purchase. Spent 265$ for 32GB RAM from Crucial 2400 MTS from Newegg website.But my observation is laptop won't use more than 16GB of RAM. So you can decide as per your requirements.When I opened 3 or 4 VMs and running them parallelly, it used at the most 12 or 13GB of RAM but the CPU usage was very high.My setting was 90% for Max CPU usage & Min is at 5% for balanced mode & for high performance - I kept the minimum at 50%. You can set this in Power settings.So my laptop's performance is still outstanding even after 5 months of purchase. It kept getting better & faster every day.Update - June 9th 2018Laptop's performance just kept getting better.Do not install Nvidia driver from the website. Let Windows install the drivers. This way you won't lose the option to connect wirelessly to your projector or TV.Performed best with Windows 1709 update. But after 1803 volume became comparatively lower.I am using Equalizer APO to boost the volume but it is still less for my liking.Windows 1803 has also messed up BluetoothThese issues are more related to Windows 10 pro 1803 update than laptop itself.So watch out for these two problems.Having said that. Windows 1803 improved gaming performance.I can also watch Netflix wirelessly using Intel WiDi on my laptop connected to projector with HDMI dongle.Cheers!Sam",1,0,1,2,2

The processor is kaby lake and because of that smaller nano circuitry windows 7 should not be compatible.

But my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises, both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk. Even when I was watching YouTube or streaming Netflix this thing kicked up immediately, even with low settings and the battery saver mode on. The performance for the build seems lacking and struggled with 3 explorer windows open and one excel file while I was doing research and nothing in the background. Which you should be able to run with an I-5, I could accept this if it was an M3 or bottom of the bucket system but not with this.Consideration: If you are of average frame and strength then this build will be perfect and the keyboard flex and body is the perfect fit between lightweight and rigidity. My friends, both female and male, are going to by this set up for their travel needs but for me it is lacking. Please take in consideration that I stand at 6' x 255 and have a combined total of 1600 + on the big three lifts in power lifting so I am large and strong. This adds to my need for a strong system and willing to sacrifice some weight for strength. Also I do a lot of research as well as build systems so this may be my over expectations kicking in just a tad, if you are coming from only using low end systems this is probably a half grade up (C+ or B) systemBest For: If you are looking for a travel laptop and are planning on doing light work this is an amazing buy for the price. Not only is it light the battery charger is tiny and with the thin bezels this is a super compact design. Even with the fan and heat if you use a cool mat on your lap you will be find especially with the screen being amazing for the price. And with all the ports available it is hard to go wrong.For the price it is an amazing starting point and hard to beat especially with such an amazing brand such as ASUS. Always loved ASUS and they build amazing machines. Oh and this is a BEAUTIFUL machine and the lid is amazing. I am just going to save for a step up. If you can save for 750 - 800 I would recommend going up a bit in the ASUS line.",1,4,1,2,2

It is still working fast and it's not glitchy. One thing that I do not like about it is the screen brightness when it's not plugged in. I have it on 100% brightness when it's unplugged and it's equivalent to around 50% brightness when it's plugged in. I get it's a good way to save battery, but I'd like to have the choice to have full brightness and deal with having my battery die faster. Other than that, I love it. And since I'm on this thing all day for work, maybe it's for the best that I don't have the full power brightness on my eyes all the time.Also, it looks really sleek and is so flat! And the finger pad is the perfect sensitivity and has the 2-finger scroll option which I love! It's a really great value and I would definitely recommend.",1,4,1,3,2

I'm not sure if I did something on my end for it to take so long, or if this is just how long it takes? It's super light, which I will love for when I am in school.

The computer is still a little slow for my taste, but I am updating my rating from 1 star to 3 Stars because it is adequate for the price.Original reviewThe SLOWEST pig of a laptop ever. I tried to disable or uninstall all the hog programs, and the performance is insanely poor. I am a week to late to return it, I may try and have it ""repaired"". It locks up multiple times.

1247,"Been messing with this for a few weeks now, and so far it's pretty decent for the price. I got this for my girlfriend as a cheap alternative gaming laptop since we're on a tight budget. This is no where near something like an alienware laptop for instance, but for the games we've installed its definitely serviceable. We were running Mortal Combat X on it at medium settings the game was playable but would chug at times. It feels a little cheap in terms of its construction quality and is not a rugged machine but if that doesn't bother you its very functional for the price. As well the screen is a little de-saturated and not the highest resolution, but again this is a trade off for the price. On the one we received one of the USB ports its pretty tight but otherwise works fine. Probably one of my biggest concerns for this computer is the battery. The battery life isn't very good, at all probably because the battery is tiny. If you're just using this for typing, viewing documents or maybe some web browsing with the brightness all the way down you can get 4 - 5 hours tops on this. If you're for instance playing even an easily run game on the machine with 15 - 25% brightness you may get 1 - 2 hours tops.So for the price its a decent choice for what you're getting out of it.

1259,"For my purposes, this is the best Windows laptop under $1,500 right now. I bought this laptop about three months ago and it has been my regular machine for work. I am absolutely not going back to the old work laptop (HP 820 G3) and don't think I'd take the other Surface offerings.Things I adore:The 3:2, high-resolution touchscreen is hands down the best screen for getting things done on the go. This blows the prison issue HP Elitebook 820 G3's 16:9 screen out of the water, and, to my untrained eye, is as bright and precise as my 2017 Macbook Pro (used for home use - I like separation of church and state). The 3:2 aspect ratio is magical for the usual trio of Outlook, Excel, and Word.Things I like:In terms of form factor - this reminds me a lot of an older Macbook Air. It's just about the right size, and is featherweight. I'm satisfied with battery life, speakers, and performance. Docking (with one exception, mentioned below in the ""things I hate"" section) is easy and works every time.Things I don't like:The keyboard (lots of pressure necessary to type - much prefer a ThinkPad up to and including T420 keyboard), and general surroundings in alcantara. One of my cars has an alcantara headliner and pillars - which is great because I never touch them. The gray alcantara is begging to get dirty and I think I'm already seeing a bit of a shadow where my right palm rests.Would love a second USB type A port, and would love to have a Windows laptop that doesn't have coil whine. There's a hint of it if the room's silent - nothing like the Dell XPS 13 tried out and ended up returning last year.Things I hate:I'm forced to run a custom Windows 10 Enterprise image and I have scaling problems. My two external monitors are connected via a Surface Dock - two Planar specials at 1440p. I run the laptop at 125% scaling, and the monitors at 100%. No matter which Surface display/dock/whatever driver update I perform, I still have issues upon docking and undocking, that requires me to log out and log back in.",0,2,3,2,4

This is the last time I buy anything from you.Thank youFrederico Giacomini",2,2,1,2,2

1271,"When looking for a personal computer that had the processing power, memory, and capability of a $1000 computer for $500, this laptop was an obvious choice for an amazing deal. It is a ""business"" computer, however, it can be used for any function that you wish, it was just designed with the business person in mind. I am using it for college classes and it works great. There is no nonsense software that comes preloaded, only the expected programs.As the description states, it does come with Windows 10 pre-downloaded. You may get an error message on startup that your Windows version is not activated and receive an error code. DO NOT FREAK OUT. You did not get a pirated version of Windows, all you need to do is update the Windows version in your ""Settings"" and the error will be resolved and your version of Windows will reflect a registered, legitimate copy. The error has to do with IPv6/IPv4 resolution in communication with the Windows server that pushes updates.This computer is reasonably fast and functional, I have many tabs open and processes running and my characters appear as I type them with no lag whatsoever. The setup is VERY simple, you basically have to plug it in, turn it on, update your Windows version, and download Chrome or Firefox if you so choose and you will be set up. The Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, etc.) is a trial version, so you may have to purchase the software if you need it later on down the road.The only negative aspect of this computer so far is that on the palm rest and touch pad, your hands leave obvious marks from the touch. A simple wipe down solves this, it is a minor complaint.Overall, this is a GREAT laptop for the money you will pay. For an average user, you may never use all of the memory available, and it will be fast enough for your daily browsing, school, or whatever it is you do on your computer. For the more proficient users, upgrading the hard drive or RAM is fairly simple and easy, all it takes is a couple of screws and you are where you need to be.",2,2,1,2,2
1272,this computer turns it self offthen you have to wait a while to turn it back oni do not recommend this computer,3,4,5,4,3
1273,"I just got my new laptop in the mail last night, and I am very happy with it so far. I read the reviews before I bought it, and I think a lot of the reviewers bought the version of this computer with just the regular hard drive. I sprung the extra ~$90 for the 128 gb sold state hard drive. When I plugged in and started the new computer up, I found it was very fast. So far everything is working very well, and I am happy with it. For this budget price, I think this is really an excellent buy!",1,4,1,2,2
1274,A little complicaded for me at 89yr. but it works!,2,2,1,3,2
1275,"Excellent computer, especially for the price!! I love this laptop - the SSD is extremely fast (startup takes less than 8 seconds), computer stays cool and quiet, backlit keyboard is beautiful, screen resolution is great, and comes with 3 USB ports. I downloaded the driver to dock this baby for 2 more screens and it works flawlessly. I would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone.",2,2,3,2,2
1276,"A great laptop. The weight is a killer spec. Only 1.6 kilogram which is 1.5 times less then my previous 15"" laptop. The screen is ok (better then my previous laptop but not as good as my desktop). SSD+HDD combo is good if you need both speed and storage. I initially thought that just SSD would be a better option so it would be a little bit lighter and spent less power (but would have less storage). Battery is disappointing a little bit (it is not a long lasting one. I initially thought it would be enough for a day, but it is actually for 3-5 hours of work).I like the keyboard and touchpad. As well as fingerprint which allows to log in quickly.Overall great product.",1,2,1,2,3
1277,"Don't buy this laptop. I am highly disappointed with this product. I purchased one as a backup to my work laptop and one for a client as a closing gift. I've only had it a week when it started to lag and freeze. Storage is horrible and other than how pretty it is, it may as well just be kept in a display case since it doesn't function properly. I just received a text from my client asking me if I purchased a warranty. Luckily, I can take them back. Such an inconvenience.",2,4,5,4,3
1278,"I thought I was ordering the laptop in the picture, all black, but what I got was a greyish color with a blue keyboard and was a Chromebook. Not what I ordered, but it seems to work well so far and it also came when I was told I would get it.",3,1,5,4,3
1279,I had just got the laptop yesterday from the mailing company and the laptop ran fine while I was using it by my parents house. When I got home it was like I had owned the laptop for 5 years and have several viruses and spyware on it. It took forever to start up during which time the fan got really loud. When the desktop finally came up it took forever for everything to start. Typing was delayed by at least 2 seconds. It became unbearable to use so I decided to wipe the hard drive clean and install a fresh copy of windows 10 64-bit. Of course I installed all of the necessary drivers. But then I notice while I was playing a movie that the sound was choppy I figured maybe it was the video file. I was wrong everything I played from any site or on the VLC player I installed every couple of minutes the sound would come off choppy for about 8-11 seconds. Now the other problem I noticed was the I was not getting the 5 GHz signal from the wireless options even though in the description it says that this laptop is wireless 802.11 b/g/n. I of reset my router and modem and still nothing. My iPhone and my wife's $250 Lenovo laptop which she has owned close to two years now runs faster than this laptop and can pick up the 5 GHz signal so I know its not a router issue. This is probably a factory defect or something. The laptop runs faster now that it has a fresh copy of windows installed but still sluggish for a new laptop and also the audio is choppy along with me not being able to pick up the 5 GHz signal from my Linksys router. I am highly disappointed in this product if you are looking for a laptop look elsewhere and save yourself the head ache. This is actually the 1st review I have ever written for a product I just had to express my disappointment.Update: I contacted HP about the wireless issue and it turns out that this model is not dual band so 5GHz will not show as a wireless option. You will have to purchase a wireless usb dual band adapter if you want the 5 GHz signal.,1,1,1,3,1

I'll just mention one downside: the i7 version gets HOT, uncomfortably hot to leave it on your lap (especially if you're wearing shorts!). I'll look for an option to slow the processor while I'm running it on battery, which might reduce the heat a bit without killing performance. All thin laptops have this issue, but just wanted to point it out.",0,2,3,2,4

1302,"The Stream is a pretty decent laptop for college students running on a tight budget. It's good for casual web surfing, playing media such as videos and music, schoolwork, and can even play some light gaming (League of Legends on extremely low settings). The only drawbacks I found since buying this in August was the storage space and mousepad. The internal memory goes up to 32GB and since it runs on Windows 10 there are updates that will take up the storage pretty quick. Also, the mousepad can be unresponsive and sluggish when moving the mouse around the screen. To solve these issues, you can either buy a microSD card (it can go up to 64GB) and insert it in the small slot on the right side, or delete some factory apps that are pre-installed on the Stream to save space, and buy a mouse (either USB wired/wireless) to make the best out of the Stream. Overall, I found the Stream to be an awesome buy for its price. It's not the best laptop nor a bad laptop but it definitely gets the job done.",3,2,5,4,6

Only left is to put the SSD. One thing though... When i was taking off the HDD bracket.. Three screws were locked so tight that i had to precisely cut the bracket so i can have at least half of it to put it back with the newly upgraded HDD. Now.. Dell.. Unfortunately wamted me to pay to it the service. Even under warranty within the first month and a half ..it is technically a defect, and they want me to fork over forty something dollars and send it to the service center also, and i can't do it cause i am in college..

That's pretty impressive for the price as it is a very system demanding game. Plus, it looks pretty sleek. The battery doesn't last long if it's not plugged in but it's not intended to. This pc is intended for performance which takes power. If you need something that is going to have a long battery life for hanging out online or doing homework, you'll want to choose something different. We have only had it a week so I will update with any issues that arise.Dropping this rating to 3 stars. After just under 2 months of use - the keyboard stopped working. I tried to update the driver, was up to date. Tried to reinstall the driver, that did not repair it. Then I made the mistake of just shutting it down. Well...the power button is ON THE KEYBOARD. That means, once shut down, I was unable to turn it back on. It's now being sent in for repairs.Bumping this back to 4 stars because acer repair was very fast.

I need this to multi task for school and although this does the job, I am sad to say it isn't as quick as I was hoping for. For a few hours everything and then windows and other updates were prompting. I started to update programs and had an error with HP accelerometer program. I successfully deleted the program restarted the computer and reinstalled a newer driver edition. NOW everything is running without any issues.The battery life is very disappointing and the fact that HP states 9hrs of operating is just crazy. I have on a full charge been lucky to get 4.5 without the backlit keyboard and with power saving options selected.Overall I do recommend this computer if you are in need of something that is very light weight and easy to carry around, just make sure to bring your charger.

That 1060 Max-Q GPU will handle most current titles on playable settings but don't expect to max out your settings on the newest AAA titles.2. I've also used it to edit some short <10min videos and it handles that without much of a hiccup either.3. I've seen a few complaints about the screen but for my purposes, I've found it quite clear.4. Battery life is decent when not plugged in. I haven't tested how long it will last but i've used it for web browsing and YouTube unplugged and 3 hours later it still had around 50% battery life. I suspect it will get 6+ hours on light to moderate use.Cons:1. It's a little big and heavy so lugging it around for a long time isn't ideal.2. The keyboard isn't the best. But I use a Lenovo T-series for work so it might be a bad point of comparison.3. The bezelsaround the screen are around 2cm all around (close to an inch).All in all I can't fault it.

Some of the handwriting apps work beautifully with the pen.The screen is the best laptop screen I've used at any price. The images are clear, crisp and exceptionally bright.

I wanted at least 2 GHz cores. I wanted 16gb memory and I wanted fast memory. I wanted a better resolution than what I had before (1366 x 768) so I could see more of each app I was using. And I wanted to finally have an SSD drive. This system was exactly what I needed. It's literally perfect. It boots up in 30 seconds. I no longer wait for Photoshop to open.

1340,"Gaming machines are Windows computers that actually work. This is a very solid, sleek, fast laptop.Pros:- Fast i5 enhanced by a dedicated Nvidia 1050 GPU to take some load off. The i5 in this machine benchmarks at 80% of the speed of an i7 @ 3.30GHz using CPU-Z in single threaded mode, but in mult-ithreaded mode the i7 is over 10x faster. Some of that difference could be the laptop is running single channel memory from a single 8GB SODIMM, instead of a matched set of RAM cards in most desktops. In real world use, Windows 10 is such a pig and so slow anyway, that installing a single, larger, cheaper SODIMM is the smart choice for overall performance, because having more slower memory is faster than having less faster memory. But adding a second, matched 8GB 2400 SODIMM to bring the machine up to 16GB would likely speed up the machine some.- I think the design is gorgeous: simple, reasonably thin, very rigid- GREAT GREAT GREAT front facing speakers, for a laptop. Spacious stereo imaging and the laptop actually gets loud. There is even a little bit of genuine bass. A lot better than low end external speakers, and on par with a Beats Pill.- Keyboard has a nice feel, and the backlighting is just right. There's a little light bleed from around the keys that is inconsistently bright when viewed from a low angle, but overall the backlighting is good.- The IPS screen is impressively bright and sharp, but it is not nearly as colorful as my Dell Ultrasharp2913UW when attached as an external monitor (photo comparisons attached). Note: the external monitor in the photos is being driven by the Nvidia chips and the laptop screen is being driven by the Intel chips, which might have some impact on color quality. Yes, the color of the laptop screen is inferior to a pricey external monitor, but it definitely looks better than 90% of laptops out there, and it is an IPS unit, not a TN. Based on the poor screen reviews here, I thought this came with a TN screen so I bought a third party IPS screen model # AU OPTRONICS B156HAN01.1. The replacement IPS screen was slightly less vibrant and less colorful than the Dell, plus it suffers from much worse light bleed near the corners and has two very annoying hot pixels right in the middle. Both screens are AMAZINGLY sharp, much sharper even than my Dell 2913UW, but also a lot smaller with the same 1080 vertical resolution. So the other reviewers are wrong, new Dell 7567s DO come with an IPS screen--confirmed. The attached photo that is missing the laptop's screen bezel (white wiring exposed) shows the OPTRONICS B156HAN01.1 screen--the color and brightness is no better and the Dell's IPS screen, maybe worse.- Three USB 3.0 ports- Dell's great 7Amp external power supply.- Not too heavy and feels solid.- Supports a 4K second monitor. The 1050 drives the second monitor by default to provide excellent gaming speed and video editing power.- One screw, easy access to the RAM and HDD/SSD bays. Awesome!Cons:- The Dell 5000 has the almost the same specs for $100 less, except the great gaming case and speakers, but that i5 is a gen behind and the screen is lower res.- Dell screwed up the bios settings, making the exellent Samsung 960 M.2 Nvme SSDs incompatible at the motherboard level. Depite the horror stories, I gave it a go anyway. The Samsung SSD slides right into the empty slot (my config came only with a 1TB HDD). Once installed and unformated, the Dell sees it right away, so cloning the existing HDD boot patitition to the SSD is a breeze. But once formatted, the SSD disappears. The trick was to return the BIOS to it's default settings. There is another option to return to ""factory"" settings---dont pick that one. Now the Samsung M.2 SSD works great. Boot time dropped from 39 secs to 19 secs.- The motherboard treats an advanced SSD as a basic SATAdevice, so Samsung's free Magician software has none of the advanced, high speed features enabled. Bummer.- The included 5400RPM mechanical harddrive is slow and it slows the whole machine to a chug. I wouldn't even consider using this machine with Windows running off that hard drive--way too slow.Overall Conclusions:- Adding an 250GB SSD then cloning it to be your boot drive adds $150 but makes a huge difference running all applications under Windows 10.- The cheaper i5 is very competitive with the i7 in single threaded mode (productivity applications) but is only 9% as fast in multi threaded mode.So if you are buying this gaming laptop because the usual productivity-focused laptops are generally garbage, go for it. If you are actually buying this for gaming, I would DEFINITELY spring for the i7 version, since it has an Nvidia 1050 ti instead of base 1050, has 10x faster multi-threaded CPU performance, and it comes with more RAM and a small SSD as standard. That said, if the SSD uses the 2.5 inch drive bay, you're going to have to remove it for more storage and buy an m.2 SSD.Overall, this is a really great and satisfying laptop and I'm glad I bought it.",1,0,1,2,2

1346,"After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for. While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone's mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain? 2) is it worth the premium price? 3) why isn't USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design: The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL). This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy. You can open the lid with one finger. In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops. The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard. Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4's. It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors. Sounds wonderful. But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad. So, how long can alcantara last? A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time. Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards. Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard.""Is this worth all your beer money?"" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It's not that you can't get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time. Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range. Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn't a single comparable Windows laptop out there. I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience. In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure. This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain. Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store. When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet. Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go). To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn't Microsoft put in some USB-C ports? For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds). Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future. Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing. What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C. This creates a big headache for the consumer. If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work. More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A). In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of ""having something that works today"" vs. ""having something that will work in the future but probably not today."" It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port. In my mind, I'm okay with not having the USB-C port. USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I'm not very big on carrying multiple dongles. As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for: This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don't require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies). Engineers might want to double check their schools' recommendation before taking the plunge. If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you! I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier. I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.",0,2,3,2,4

1412,"Awful. I've had this computer for about 10 months now and the case to my never-leaves-my-desk, completely-babied laptop broke. Googled it, and it looks like it's a common issue--a screw that holds the case together near the power input and the LCD screen breaks and the case pulls apart. If you're thinking, ""Oh, if it's a common problem then Dell will repair the issue free-of-charge"", then you'd be wrong. They want to charge me $239 to fix my otherwise pristine laptop WHILE IT IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. Yes, you read that right. This laptop is still under warranty (whatever that means for a Dell product), and they still want me to pay to fix a documented flaw in their design on the less-than-a-year-old computer.So no, I would not recommend. And this is from someone who has been a loyal Dell purchaser since her first computer. I've already canceled my Dell credit card over this with how bad their service department has handled this. I'm not usually one to complain (especially without trying to resolve the issue--I don't have time for that kind of negativity in my life), but I felt I needed to speak out on this one.

1419,"The Chromebook plus is hands down the most satisfying laptop I have ever owned.The screen is gorgeous - high color, high resolution, and perfect for we browsing and text editing. The way the screen folds over and the laptop acts as either laptop, tablet or a monitor-on-a-wedge is impressive; it's never been annoying to switch, so far all my scenarios just work.The keyboard - the single reason why I have passed on multiple alternative laptop purchases in the past year is surprisingly good. It's nothing to write home about, lacks a backlight and has a short delete and tabs key as well as no caps lock key, but it works more than well enough in everyday use. My takeaway is that key travel might be the most important characteristic for me, and it has sufficient key travel to make typing comfortable.Speed is not an issue - this is probably the first ARM laptop to be useable, the RK3399 hexacore really shows it's value.The speakers are surprisingly powerful - we just watched the soccer word cup game on the laptop, and it was lifelike.I have installed linux on the system and can both dual boot or use via crouton without issues.Battery life is phenomenal (effectively all day, 6h to 9h depending on usage), and the laptop can charge through the left as well as the right side USB-C port. Charge time is typically less than 40m.Downsides:(1) A keyboard backlight would have been nice(2) A slightly less glossy screen would have been helpful(3) A sim card slot and cell modem would make this the ultimate ultra-portable.",2,4,5,4,5

Its keyboard types well but the track pad leaves a bit to be desired. The screen quality is more than adequate for the price especially taking the 1920x1080 resolution into consideration.

1433,"After a couple of bad experiences with a competitive laptop, I decided to go for the new Microsoft Surface Laptop. I basically work over the Internet, work with Office 365 and keep absolutely nothing on my laptop.... everything is kept off the machine on an external drive. Because of that I decided to go for the i5, 4 GB, 128 Gig model. I felt it would be more than adequate for what I do... and I was right. I am by no means a ""power user"" that has multiple apps or programs open at the same time. If that is you, then I would recommend getting the i5, 8GB, 256 Gig SSD model. But that is just not me, so the base model works great for me.First of all, lets get out of the way the design, quality of build and the rather unique alcantara fabric keyboard and deck covering.... it's all top drawer. This is built like a tank, yet its in a form factor that is very thin and compact. Simply put, its a beautiful laptop. The keyboard is excellent with a good amount of key travel and they are comfortable to use. The track pad is as good as any I have used on a Windows machine. No, its not the glass type that you find on an Apple MacBook Pro... but that's ok. I personally don't use the track pad anyway... so not a big deal for me. The keyboard is back-lit and easy to work with in low light conditions.I do a lot of live streaming of content over Xfinity and this screen is as good as my MacBook Pro with Retina screen. I actually like this a bit better. The picture quality is crisp and colors are sharp and precise. It is covered in Gorilla Glass 3 so will be highly reflective if you have a light in front of it or outside in the open daylight. None -the-less, it's a beautiful screen and certainly at the top of it's class.The only drawback for some might be the lack of connectors and SD Card slot. The machine comes with a USB 3.0, 3.5mm Headset jack, mini DisplayPort and Surface Connect. I like the Surface Connect Power plug as it is somewhat similar to the old Apple magnetic connector... if you happen to hit it, it pops out without doing damage to the connector. Sadly, Apple did away with that on the latest version of the MacBook products. That said, I can see where I am going to have to buy a couple of dongles for connecting to various peripherals.The Surface Laptop comes loaded with Windows S... which is useless if you want to download any apps that aren't on the Microsoft Store site... like iTunes. You have the ability to upgrade to a 1 year free subscription of Windows Pro. It's $49 annually after the first year. I have no clue why Microsoft would sell their newest, higher end, laptop with Windows S. Maybe they will simply give in and allow everyone to upgrade and forget the annual fee. One can only hope. I upgraded of course and will continue to use Windows Pro.I guess the long and short of it is that I am just a regular guy (a Consultant) that uses his laptop everyday for everyday types of tasks. I don't do complex design, art or mathematical work on the machine with numerous applications open at the same time. As I stated earlier, that is just not me. This laptop is simply put, the best laptop I have ever had. It is a beautiful, well built, technologically strong machine that will serve me well for a number of years. I can't recommend this enough. It is a real winner and Microsoft has hit a home run without question.",1,2,3,2,4

1437,So I bought this laptop and I really like the speed of the SSD. The only problem I found was that the ram chip that came with it is garbage. I bought 2 8 gig crucial Ram chips that they recommend with it and it's really screaming now and have not had a problem with it freezing while playing Doom like I did with the original 8gig ram chip that came with it. I couldn't play more than 30 minutes before it froze now I don't have to worry about it. The packaging was excellent and it came right on time. All the games I've played I have played with graphics on Max and the computer doesn't miss a beat.,1,0,3,2,2

I've had to use lots of super glue just to keep it together since I cannot afford another PC. I had a toshiba laptop before this with slightly worse specs for 3 years, and only had to replace that because the charging port of the motherboard died (tried just replacing the piece but was a no go). Considering I haven't had this one even a year and it's given so much trouble (started within a month but was managabe) I can't recommend this PC if you plan on actually keeping one for any decent length of time.",1,0,1,2,2
1447,"I have purchased and used literally over a dozen notebooks over the last two decades. The Acer Aspire is an intriguing machine- for the right purposes.This Acer Aspire 1 is a budget priced Microsoft notebook, designed to compete with Chromebooks. The specs are modest with 4 GB of RAM, and a Celeron N3450 processor, although this is a quad core (but not hyperthreaded) part, and has a little more performance than some other Celeron parts, like the ubiquitous N3060.Perhaps the most limiting component is the ""hard drive"" which is eMMC and 32 GB total capacity. As the machine ships, it has just under 10 GB available storage space, so those looking to store a lot would be better off with another machine.This type of drive is really the cousin of a flash card, and has speeds that are fairly slow.The other ports are fairly good, with 3 USB ports (one even 3.0), and an Ethernet port that has Gigibit speeds. There is also an SD card slot, that is full sized. There is also a full size HDMI port. The wireless supports both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies.The keyboard is fairly good, with no clear shortcomings. Key travel is decent, especially for such a slim machine that is 0.9"" thick. The display is a TN panel, with medicore color range, limited viewing angles, and less than stellar color brightness and contrast. However, it is 1080p, which gives it a smooth look, and video watching is acceptable on this device.The design is fanless, and never really gets hot in use. It was able to smoothly play a 4K YouTube video without any stutter. The outside of the machine has a nice textured feel that hides fingerprints. Almost needless to say at this price point is that the whole notebook chassis is made from plastic, and a drab black one at that.For power users that wish to play games, edit video, or other resource intensive tasks, this Acer Aspire 1 is clearly not the machine for them. I also would not recommend it as a user's only PC, as none of the parts are top notch, nothing can be upgraded, and the storage is limiting.However, as a secondary machine, this Acer Aspire 1 is a bargain. It is kind of a netbook reborn, a Chromebook competitor, and tablet replacement all in one package. When we factor in the sub-$200 price point, and the quad core CPU, nothing else really competes with it. In my case, I just needed a machine to interface with a printer and scanner in a basement, but after buying, I like the 14"" size, and find myself using this for simple web surfing and emails, and it performs quite well, a sort of ""Internet appliance."" I could also see this being used for school age children or the elderly that need more than a Chromebook to be able to add a few simple programs, as it easily ran Paint.net and LibreOffice with no issues, while having multiple tabs open in the browser. It would also be handy for travel as the compact size, light weight and long battery life make it ideal, and at a bargain price that makes it less painful if it gets lost.The main competitor to this Acer Aspire 1 is the HP Stream. While the HP Stream 14 comes in more fashionable colors, I prefer the Acer Aspire 1 as it has the quad core CPU with more processing power over the HP Stream's dual core Celeron part, and the Ethernet port on the Aspire 1. Both have 4 GB of RAM, and the 32 GB eMMC, and both are often similarly priced around $200 (although the Aspire 1 is often priced a little less, and has better specs).",3,4,5,4,3

1459,"I've only had this laptop for a few days, so at some point I may come back and update this review. However, for now I wanted to give a review based on my experience after first using the computer. Right out of the box this thing ran slower than a 3 year old Samsung Satellite that I picked up on here for about $500.This Asus was so brutally slow out of the box it took me 2.5 hours to install Adobe Creative Suite from an installer I downloaded! Even before the install it would take almost 2 minutes to open Windows and launch any software.Before I did a return I decided to re-install Windows. After the the computer ran like a normal computer. Although it still seemed a little slow for an i7 with 8 gigs of RAM. But, overall everything is running much better.So it looks like whatever software ASUS is pre-installing on this thing is terrible. Please ASUS do something about your pre-loaded software.

1461,"I've owned this for two weeks, and I'm right at the end of the return period, waffling between keeping it and taking it back. I think I'll keep it, because the positives outweight the negatives ... slightly. Read on.Positives:- Very light. At 2.4 lbs, it's practically made of feathers.- Fantastic screen. Insanely high-res, very bright, and the 3:2 aspect ratio is great for this screen size. Side-by-side windows display fine too--plenty of room.- The keyboard feels pretty good. I'd have liked a little more key travel, but it's a very thin machine, so I understand the trade-off, and don't really mind. I wish the backspace key were bigger, as lots of others do. It's very easy to miss when typing.- The trackpad feels pretty good too, and is decently large. It's not the size of Texas, like you might find on a MacBook, but it's big enough. Physical clicks are possible only along the bottom half or so, but light taps work anywhere, as is the norm. Feels good in general.- Reasonably fast performance for the price. The Plus has an ARM hexa-core chip. I don't have a same-gen Intel Chromebook on hand to benchmark against, but it's fast enough for most of the light work and web browsing I've been doing on it. Some instances of lag, but nothing deal-breaking.Negatives, and instances of bugginess:- The battery life isn't the advertised 10 hours. It's more like 6-7 hours, mostly doing light web browsing.- The build quality's not that great. If you grip the right-hand side of the keyboard area, you can feel some give, as the bottom half and the top half squeeze together. There's an audible creak during this too.- When using the stylus, there's no palm rejection, meaning you can't rest your palm on the screen while writing or drawing, because it'll register as touch input. I understand most phones and tablets don't have palm rejection either, but their screens are much smaller, and thus easier to avoid touching. The Plus's screen is huge by comparison, and your paws are guaranteed to touch it while stylus-ing, especially in tablet mode. This limits the built-in stylus's usefulness quite a bit. It's a nice bullet point in Samsung's marketing, but that's about it.- A general Chrome OS gripe: for something billed as a tool that makes great use of the net and eschews large local storage, it's terrible at working with remote shares. Google's SMB app doesn't display thumbnails in remote shares, and when copying large files (or many smaller files), it fails partway through. Chromebooks have been around forever now--how is it still this bad in 2017?- The folding screen / tablet mode has been buggy for me so far. In one instance, when folding the screen back all the way, all my running apps crashed and disappeared. This was in an account with no third-party add-ons installed--totally clean. In another instance, folding back the screen failed to enter tablet mode fully: the UI wouldn't re-orient based on the Chromebook's orientation. Following that, after folding the screen back to its normal position, keyboard input failed to re-enable, necessitating a reboot. I've tried tablet mode only a handful of times so far, but half those attempts have been buggy. That ain't good. I realize Android mode on Chromebooks isn't ready for prime-time, but this isn't even about that--this is a general tablet mode built into the Plus, so you'd expect it to work regardless.- I've had a few instances after rebooting where the wireless connection didn't work, necessitating more rebooting.- I once woke it from sleep to find there was no mouse cursor on the screen, and trackpad input did nothing. I used the keyboard to tab through my accounts and log in, after which the mouse cursor appeared and the trackpad worked again.- I had 12-14 tabs open at one point, which I'll admit was pushing my luck (I usually have far fewer open). Chrome crashed, with no error message of any kind. Just vanished. Upon re-launch, it opened nothing but an empty tab, as if it had no idea it'd done anything wrong.- Various other crashes, in all sorts of situations.The bugginess is all over the place, making me think that I don't have a faulty unit, but rather that these are problems with the Plus in general, and in some part with Chrome OS itself. Two weeks of light use with all the above problems? Pretty discouraging. I think I just talked myself out of keeping it. :(",2,4,5,4,5

The casing has a solid sturdy feel that is a major improvement from the plastic cased laptops I've had over the years. It is very sleek and the lack of screws and venting make for smooth, uninterrupted lines. There is fabric on the deck and I have to say that it's one of the best highlights of the machine. Normally I end up with sweaty or sticky palms/wrists when typing for an extended period of time, but not anymore. The laptop also generates far less heat than any I have ever used before. I don't have to put it on top of a pillow when I'm sitting on the couch and it seems to stay pretty cool to the touch. The keypad and track pad are total stunners on this machine. Both seem almost perfect in their response and tactile feeling. I like the back-lighting adjustment feature for the keypad so that I can conserve battery power when using it at night. I am also impressed with the speakers and how they are located under the keyboard, keeping the deck looking sleek and slimmed down. They do put out very good sound for laptop speakers too. I have noticed people complaining about the lack of USB-C ports.......I don't really know what that is. This machine has enough for what I need to use, and I am assuming for general day to day use it will suit people just fine. The speed and performance are also on the higher end of what I am used to for general computing/word processing and other type of functions. I have a TV and a tablet already, so I am not using this for gaming or movie watching. I think that for most people who want a computer for general day to day use, this will be perfect fit. The last bit is about the OS. I have to agree with other reviewers on this portion.....it's not very useful at all. It is really the only negative thing I have to say about this laptop, and it's easily remedied anyway. Overall, if you are looking to upgrade to something that's high end, without dealing with too high of a price or more machine than you actually need, this Surface has it all. I feel like I get the aesthetics of a Mac with the familiarity and ease of use in a PC.",0,2,3,2,4
1480,"A 32 GB hard drive is completely consumed by the operating system. Yes, it has Windows 10 and that's all you'll ever have. Also, it cannot apply updates to Windows 10 because there is not enough hard drive space. Get used to an error message about that every time you turn the machine on.Also it claims to come with a year of Office products, but when you receive it there is an insert in the package that says this is no longer true. They are installed, but there is no license.I like it for being lightweight and cute, but can't recommend and wouldn't buy again.",2,2,5,4,6
1481,"Great machine!!I purchased this for my mom who found using Window 10 familiar but very confusing w/ all the changes. She absolutely loves this! She's been using it for 2 months or so and I haven't once gotten a phone call saying ""This thing is broken"" or ""Why is it soo slow?"", which was close to every other week. Both my fianc and I have been using chromebooks for sometime and love them.The only reason I'm not giving a full 5 stars is although the 'help me with my computer' calls have stopped completely now. I haven't used the machine myself apart from the initial setup.",2,4,5,4,5
1482,Perfect laptop for students. Very very simple. Not as fast as other laptops but it's bearable. There aren't as many usb ports as I like but that's fine.

The keyboard is a bit small but it's fine for my small hands.,3,1,5,4,3

1486,"This seemed to be the ideal laptop for me having had a chromebook for 5 years already. in fact, I was so keen I had it shipped from Us to UK (where it is not available). It has lived up to my expectations.Pros: excellent screen streets ahead of the majority of similar chromebooks. excellent track pad rapid boot time touch screen laptop, tablet and other modesCons: not sure it is as robust as older models. I would not recommend it for a student bag for example screen sensitive to movement and I have had to reset it a couple of times to prevent screen flickering uncontrollablyAs a mature light user (internet, emails etc) it suits me perfectly.

1491,"Came in right on time, packaged in a nice slim case that could double as a carrying case. Ultra light weight and booted right into set up. Battery has been working for over 4 hours off a full charge and continuous use. For a $200 computer I would recommend this to anyone wanting something to use on the move, or as a travel companion. Also to a elderly person looking for something simple to use. Built in speakers are plenty loud, screen is crisp and clear, and the keyboard is a compact layout without the 10 key on the right side. The keyboard is nicely centered and the mousepad is positioned where I won't accidentally click while typing. The only issue I could see anyone having is the processing speed, and if you are looking for a fast processor in this price bracket, you won't find it, so reevaluate what you want/need.",3,1,5,4,3

What I did is immediately inform Amazon and seller that the unit I received is dead on arrival. And until now ( April 3, 2018) still they not working. All of their suggestions are useless and impossible:1. They advise me to return the item from Qatar to US. Unfortunately all of the carrier like DHL etc here in Qatar are not accepting laptop specially if it is defective.2. They advise me to repair at Authorized HP Service Center, and I did also, but they need the Valid Invoice in order to repair under warranty otherwise if without invoice they will repair under post warranty and I will pay for the cost. But seller (TECH & TOYS )and Amazon cannot provide me a VALID INVOICE. VALID INVOICE is the only way in order to repair without any cost at my side amounting $340. Just a piece of paper ( VALID INVOICE ) they wont provide.So just want to share my experience and reminders specially for those ordering outside US to think many times before you place your order to them.

1505,"This is a basic laptop which I bought for reliability, durability and large disc size. Other than the nice finish on the exterior of the lid, however, this laptop does overly exude ""basic"" on all of its features. Particularly worrying is the optical drive which has an extremely flimsy, plastic extension tray/door, which I fear could easily break. The optical drive also makes quite a lot of noise while playing a DVD. Even worse are the speakers which have extremely low sound, which would make watching a DVD with several friends difficult. On the basis of the Windows 10 icons and text, the screen does look to have poor resolution even though it is technically higher than your basic laptop. It seems this maybe due to Windows 10, as my much older ASUS laptop with a 1366x768 resolution but runs Windows 7 and does look much sharper than this one being reviewed. Whereas Windows 10 icons and text do look very sharp on the high resolution of the Surface 4 tablet. The keyboard build also feels very cheap on this compared to my older ASUS basic ($500) laptop. So in all this is extremely basic and as noted by another reviewer would be best suited for kids (apart from the DVD tray door which certainly wouldn't last long with kids) rather than the business professional. In all, it feels more like this laptop should sell for $400 or less and the $500 ASUS 13"" Flip is a far better deal and build.",2,2,1,2,2

I decided to buy this Acer for my wife instead of another refurbished Dell because of the claim about graphics. The graphics on the Acer are not very good. The resolution on my kindle fire HD is much better. But the 8th generation i3 processor is fast. The battery lasts forever. The startup is almost immediate. There is tons of storage space with 1 TB. The machine doesn't get hot. One more negative. The track pad is bad. The cursor doesn't go where I want it to.,2,2,1,3,2

It has quite good storage space and the battery is enough for people who play games as well as work. It has a battery better than most of the gaming laptops. Keys are good. Don't expect the speakers to be excellent. The speakers create an echo. The display is good. Since it's a TN panel, you need to set the correct angle first, but once you're done with it, it's quite good. And for people who have lots of work on Skype or any other video calling app, the front camera is also good. Don't expect it to be as good as your phone's front cam, but in comparison to other webcams I've seen, you can call this one great. And yes the charging speed of this laptop is superb. People say it's too heavy and it's not slim, but does it really matter ?! The main thing is the performance, if the performance and processor is good, then your laptop can function well for years.

I do not know what they are talking about when they say that this laptop provides a smooth multimedia experience because this is the slowest, chuggiest, nearly impossible to use laptop that I've ever had the displeasure of using besides ancient 2 inch thick toshibas that someone filled with malware and viruses. This laptop can't even scroll down a product page on Amazon, it can't scroll down comments on tweets, it often struggles to even play a youtube video without pausing ever 2 seconds despite being totally buffered. Whenever I encounter a page with a single picture on it, trying to two finger scroll down with the touch pad results in an incomprehensibly slow delayed response that sees the page take 30+ seconds to try and catch up to the input...SLLLOOOWWWLLLLYY moving in the direction of the swipe. Somehow using the down arrows is faster and more responsive. With fiber internet, this thing seems to take ages to open up a page and even longer for it to become responsive. I've used all kinds of browsers, I've messed with power settings and its not like I've bogged it down because this thing has no room to download anything so nothing has been. You MUST buy any other laptop, I have no idea if I was somehow shipped some kind of tragically flawed version that got dropped on the inspection line, but for this money I would recommend going with just about anything else.",3,1,5,4,3

While I've only owned this device for 2 days i'm extremely happy with it. As soon as I powered the device on I had 1 update to do which gave me Android App support right after that. Browsing is great, the keyboard feels nice, the apps work as intended although some apps were designed for phones so you wont be able to full screen. If your looking for a device for basic web browsing, watching shows and doing some word docs this is an awesome device. I don't think it will completely replace a laptop but it comes pretty close at least for me it does. The stylus pen also surprising writes pretty well. Even wit the ARM processor i haven't noticed any lag with the things I've been using this for so overall I think its a great buy. I do agree with most 449 might be a little high in price but considering that high end android tablets go for high 300s, I would recommend this device over those and depending on when you reading this i got mines on sale for $350 so it was definitely worth is.",2,4,5,4,5

Because a new laptop comes with 1 year warranty from Dell, you can always find free help from a Dell representative and they will take over control of your laptop and tries to fix it.He eliminated some of the pre-installed drivers, bloatwares and updated Dell BIOS. After this took place, it became a screaming fast laptop. So, once you receive the laptop, please check with the Dell rep and ask him/her to eliminate any bloatware and drivers that came with.

1564,"In the event that I actually received the laptop I ordered, this would be a perfect review. But that didn't happen.I ordered a GTX 1050 Ti. That was very much specified in my order. And I bought the laptop immediately after Thanksgiving. Upon receiving the package, I felt something was amiss, because the box - and the laptop itself - had stated it ran on the base GTX 1050 GPU. I conducted a few tests on this front, mostly in regard to gaming (Overwatch, to be specific) and the frame-rate of that title between a 1050 and 1050ti. In short, let's say it was obvious I didn't get what I purchased. I'm sorry - but why the confusion here?Because I'll admit: it's a fantastic piece of hardware minus the somewhat flimsy plastic design around the edges of the keyboard andAcer Nitro 5 Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i5-7300HQ, GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 15.6"" Full HD, 8GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, AN515-51-55WLscreen, and my aforementioned issue.",2,0,3,2,2

It's not quite ready to replace my Tablet but I expect this to change when they switch over to the Nougat version of Android. The tablet mode is still finicky and not stable. The tablet experience will have to improve. But it's still usable and as a Chromebook is perfect.It's plenty fast, great screen, lightweight and built solid. Plus my other s-pens work with the screen (although Samsung says it's not an s-pen).You won't have any regrets buying this Chromebook.",2,4,5,4,5
1571,"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas She loved it. I have one from work and I have enjoyed mine. My two star rating comes from my experience with Samsung customer service. My daughter took her Chromebook out of the case, opened it and watched the screen shatter in front of her. She had used it for 1 month. 1. Single. Month. It was not dropped, misused, or abused. It was kept in a protective case and cosmetically pristine. I contacted Samsung customer service thinking that the screen would never be covered under the warranty and was trying to discern if it was worth it to repair. After chatting with the customer service rep and telling him several times that the screen shattered upon opening the book, he assured me it would be covered by Samsung's 12-month warranty. Fast-forward a week letter and I am told that it would cost $440 to repair (I paid $339). I then contacted customer service again, was told that it was not under warranty even though I had been misled (I included a copy of the chat transcript that was emailed to me by Samsung) and this was the response: ""Samsung does strive to produce quality products and provide best (sic) service. However, your experience did not reflect this. Here at Samsung we want to provide our customers with the best solution possible and we try to exhaust all possible resources and channels."" This made me believe that they would offer something to rectify the situation. However, this was the response I received: ""As the screen of the Chromebook has a physical crack, I'm afraid you'll be charged for the repair as per the warranty guidelines. I certainly would have helped you, had any alternative or option been available to me."" I do not believe that Samsung had no other option. They chose not to have another option. So choose wisely. I will be choosing another brand.",2,4,5,4,5

No hiccups at all. The wireless is phenomenal using the MIMO connections. I have a TP-LINK Router that supports MU-MIMO so they work great together. The system at times is a little slow even with the BOINC service shut down but I guess I'm just used to the performance of my AMD FX-8350 8 core 4Ghz processor in the big PC. I'll get used to it :-)I like the expansion on this laptop, room for a standard hard drive and two slots for memory expansion (1 already has the 8GB installed.) I'll probably upgrade the 256GB SSD with a larger one in the near future, 256 is a bit small.I'm doing my families Genealogy and since my old laptop was literally falling apart, this will be great asset when I go home and do some more research.I think this is a keeper, I've had Acer laptops in the past and had good luck with them. I'll keep you posted on any issues that may arise in the future, for now I'm very satisfied.",2,0,3,2,2

1581,"Pros:__________- Runs Chrome and Android apps.- Beautiful screen that gives you a 2400x1600. The colors are rich, sharp, and not over saturated.- Touchscreen works very well as your figures are responsive and so far have not seen any glitches that you can find on some Hp computers.- Web surfing with numerous tabs while using Microsoft still brings a quick response time.- A beautiful device for a Netflix and basic web surfing users.- The stylus pen is responsive to the screen. don't really use it though since 90% of apps out their do not need it.- The pen as well comes with perks such as a laser pointer, magnify glass, note taking, and some others that youre most likely going to use, if you'r a pen guy.- 720 webcam that you cant go wrong with those hoping to use skype well.- The built-in google play app store is a cool perk to have.- Full metal body but still weights less than 3 lbs.- I found it cool that more you write on the screen the more the computer will recognize what your spelling layout is. Meaning that taking notes will be pretty common after a couple of weeks with it (I'm still sticking with typing).- Theirs a button on the bottom right corner that allows a multi-window feature. Its a useful tool for those who want to use the fullest of their screen.- 360-degree hinges which advertise exactly as it should. A laptop and a tablet.- 4 GB RAM will make lagging obsolete for basic programming.Cons and Oks:__________- For a laptop its a great weight, but not for a tablet.- Apps that you use (Facebook, slack, telegram, Pinterest,) will reduce the battery life fast. Those require the use of the CPU will make it lose battery life even faster.- The pen falls out easily.- Not a sensitive mouse pad.- The keyboard is too close together as you will be pushing letters, numbers, and event the delete button in places that you didnt plan. Barely any room between the keys.- The Bluetooth connectivity disconnects at random times. I see this when my Bluetooth mouse suddenly stops working.- Youll need external adapters if you want to hook it up to an external display.- Not every app in the google play stores is designed for this computer. I wish I could say which ones but there isnt a limit on this issue right now.- Forget drawing on this as the lag is not great at all if the pen for drawing.- Battery life sucks as I'm getting 5 hours sometimes to ""maybe"" 8 hours (if i go into a power saver mode). This is using Microsoft office, Netflix, web surfing, music playing, etc.- Speakers suck, youll be requiring headphones when buying this. Not much bass and at max the volume isnt anything to brag about.- You lose your pen, youll need to buy another one as somehow the pen that comes with it is the only pen that will work for this screen.- No backlit keyboard.- Annoying USB type-C.- Pressing the power button will take you into lock screen before powering down (which takes an extra 30 seconds). You can change this but its still annoying enough to put it up on the list.- The accelerometer is very sensitive when getting this. Even moving the computer from one place to another sometimes makes your screen flip upside down when youre using it as a laptop.- Big borders around the screen makes everything feel like your watching a Imax movie from a basic television.- Lag issue does arise at random times.- PowerPoint, heavy Excel and Photoshop will start to see some lag.- Not much for gaming, even using Steam is out of the option.- Keep in mind that not all apps are trustworthy as there isnt much of a security layout in the app world. Phones always had limits but a computer is wide open.Bottom Line:__________Their are a lot of bugs or performance issues with this computer right now. But if the updates fix these problems than watching Netflix and web surfing will be perfect for you. Under this layout, youre going to get decent battery life, a decent response time, and be able to take it anywhere you go. Weight isn't overbearing and the image quality is spot on. For those who want entertainment and nothing more, than this is a good deal.Overall, a decent amount of apps still are unable to adapt to this computer, and is in no way a gamer laptop for those who want a little more power in a computer. Its a 80% tablet with a 60% laptop. You can do the basic of enjoyment but nothing in the high-end range regarding CPU programs / games. I tested this computer and tried to put it through everything I can give it to Verdict: Its a college computer where movies, web surfing, and medium software programs are all you need for the use of a computer/tablet. A lot of glitches/firmware issues but if they get fixed than you're going to please with the results.Hopefully I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer.",2,4,5,4,5

The warranty that comes with Amazon purchases is mail-in only, with 12 day wait times each go, and you pay out of pocket for shipping. They simply swapped the hard drive each time because it passed the cut-rate self diagnostic tool that Dell puts on your BIOS as bloatware. This machine was amazing when it ran for the first few weeks. But once it died, it got stuck ina fial to boot cycle, and I got stuck in a fail to fix cycle with Dell Support. Will never buy another Dell again. This was a terribly unreliable product, and the only thing worse is how terrible Dell support was.",1,0,1,2,2

At times, she complains about the computer ""hanging up"" for a few seconds- where she can't open or close browser or programs - then it kicks in - I'm surprised this happens with all the ram, processor speed, AND solid state HDD.I'm assuming it's because of some bloatware that Dell/Microsoft in their infinite wisdom decided to install. I'm sure if I spent a few hours diagnosing and streamlining it, I could improve the performance - but when I spend money for a new laptop - I expect it to work right without me 'tinkering' with it. How hard is it for a computer company to build a fast, streamlined PC and sell it? Most consumers don't have the knowledge or patience to work thru these issues.Also, Wifi reception could be better.

Yes, you can use the online version, but it is slow. i think they know people who are still using a Windows either:1) corporate - no choice2) Microsoft Office (again the other equivalents are getting on par; like Pages,Keynote,Numbers...and Google need to refine their Google docs,sheets and slide app)3) certain apps still work better in Windows environment (again this is changing)",2,4,5,4,5

I'll never buy a 2-in-1 that can't swivel, ever. Can rotate it to any angle, adapts right away to tablet mode. It's a solid little powerhouse that can get a bit hot, but that's expected.

Without updating the driver, you just won't have a sleep option on any menu. Also, in the hardware manager you'll see an error symbol indicating that the graphics card is having problems.

1649,"UPDATE: May 30, 2018: Do Not Buy This Laptop! The screen on mine broke for no apparent reason that I can think of. I did not drop the laptop, sit on the laptop, bend the laptop, hit the laptop on the edge of a desk or anything else that I am aware of. I handle this laptop with the utmost of care and this morning when I opened it I noticed some ""streaks"" on the screen that I attributed to cleaning with my microfiber cloth the previous day. But to my horror, it was not streaks but cracks in the screen. When I called the Microsoft Support Line, the first option was for broken screens. So do you think there is a problem with these Surface Laptops developing cracked screens? Duh. Well yeah. Unless you purchased the optional extended warranty, you are going to have to pay $450 for an out of warranty replacement. Sorry Microsoft, Not going to happen. You've lost a customer. UPDATE:July 3, 2017 - I visited a Microsoft Store today. I spent about an hour with a tech who ran the battery test again on my Surface Laptop. The results were basically the same as the results gotten when the Microsoft Support online tech ran the same test. The Surface Laptop battery has a design capacity of 45,200mWh but my battery has a full charge capacity of 48,500mWh. In other words, my battery has more capacity than the design capacity. That will diminish with time of course because Li-ion batteries lose capacity slowly over time. In fact the first time I ran the battery test my battery showed a full charge capacity of 50,000mWh so it has already lost some of that capacity just in the short time I've had the laptop.The most recent run of the Battery Test indicated an estimated battery life based on my usage pattern of 7:13:43 which is essentially what I mentioned I get in my review. The estimated battery life based on the design capacity of the battery is only 6:44:12. The tech basically admitted that the touted 14.5 hour video loop statistic that Microsoft touts is something that no one will get in real life usage. The takeaway is that there is nothing wrong with my battery or with my laptop. The laptop simply does not get anywhere near the advertised 14.5 runtime. So if you are expecting 11, 12 or 13 hours of runtime, you will be disappointed. As for the laptop magazines that run tests that indicate exaggerated runtimes, be very wary. Even Wired magazine agrees that 9-10 hours is a more realistic expectation although I've never gotten close to 10 hours.UPDATE: July 1, 2017 - My review states my overall impressions of the laptop. What I want to update is my great disappointment in the battery life. Microsoft is marketing this as having up to 14.5 hours of video playback (tested using Windows 10 Pro so you would assume that Windows 10s would have slightly better battery life.) The reality after using this for nearly 2 weeks is that I am only getting 7-7.5 hours of battery life. My use of the laptop is mostly word processing, email, Browsing Amazon, Spotify and occasional YouTube video streaming. I contacted Microsoft Technical Support and had a 1 hour chat session where the technician actually ran a screen sharing session on my laptop to check and change settings to help optimize battery life (such as turning off Hey Cortana setting.) He even ran a comprehensive battery usage report which indicated detailed battery use statistics for the previous 3 day period of time. What was gleaned from that was that my battery is discharging at an average rate of 12-15% per hour. Well, do the math. At that rate of discharge, there is no way you'll ever get 14.5 hours of battery life. I feel the whole 14.5 hour of battery life is a misleading metric that is only remotely possible under unlikely circumstances. I purchased this laptop primarily because of the touted long battery life. Now that I've had the Surface Laptop long enough I am able to conclude I will never see anywhere close to the 14.5 hours battery life claimed in the marketing hype. I am very disappointed, I routinely get no more than 7.5 hours of use before needing to recharge, and in some cases only 6.5 hours on a full charge. While I am very happy with the speed of the laptop and gorgeous design, the battery life is not at all meeting my expectations. That is why I am reducing my rating to 3 stars.---- This is a review of the Microsoft Surface Laptop (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB) - Platinum.I'm having a real love-hate relationship with this laptop. First let me give it some love...What a gorgeous laptop. It is thin, lightweight and has excellent build quality. There are no seams on the shell of this laptop. It looks like it was machined out of a solid hunk of aluminum. The laptop is rigid and does not flex. I can hold the front corner of the laptop and it feels totally solid in my hand.The display has touchscreen capabilities and has a 3 x 2 aspect ratio, like the good ol days. The touchscreen is very responsive with no perceptible lag. You can use a stylus with the touchscreen if you wish but the screen only goes back so far and can not be folded underneath the laptop as a would be able to do with a convertible laptop. Pixel density is 201ppi with the screen resolution of 2256 x 1504. That makes it great for working on documents and writing. But with a 3x2 aspect ratio, you may be bothered by the black bars that will be visible on the top and bottom areas of the screen. The display has gorilla glass to give it added strength. The display does have significant glare if used outside or light from windows or lights. I find that I sometimes have to choose my work position carefully to avoid glare. The screen is bright and sharp with excellent color.The only ports are a USB 3 port, a Mini Display Port and an audio output jack, all of those on the left side. The right side has the Surface Connect Docking & Power Port. The AC adapter is small and has a USB output for charging (it is not a data port.)I really like the Windows Hello face recognition feature for unlocking the laptop. It works quite well generally speaking but low light and strong backlighting can render it useless in which case you'll have to unlock the laptop using your PIN. Not a big deal.The trackpad is excellent. One of the best trackpads I've used. I also like the feel and look of the somewhat controversial Alcantara fabric that surrounds the keyboard and trackpad. It feels good when you rest your hand on it, but I do wonder whether in time oils from my skin will cause it to get shiny, collect dirt and who knows what. I'm on the fence about the Alcantara fabric.The laptop has plenty of cons. First and foremost is the fact that there is nothing upgradeable on this laptop. What you get is what you get. This concerns me greatly. It basically means you have a $1200 throwaway computer once the battery loses it's ability to hold a charge, a fate common to all Li-ion batteries. Unless Microsoft has some magical way that nobody knows about to open the laptop up and replace the battery this is a huge consideration. I'm also not happy that there is no SD Card slot. Since there is a USB 3 port, you can certainly use an external USB hard drive or external SSD drive but still, I'd like to have an SD card slot.The lack of USB-C is also something I don't understand. This is the future of USB and the lack of USB-C seems like a big omission to me.Now let me address my thoughts about the Windows 10s operating system. I'm really conflicted about this. Windows 10s limits your ability to download apps outside of the Store. Microsoft didn't even have Spotify in their Store until recently. I'm encouraged that more and more apps will be added to the Store but am dismayed that some apps that I used to use regularly on my other Windows laptop, iPad and Chromebook, like iTunes, Chrome Browser and YouTube are not available in the Store.Another peculiar obstacle is that you cannot change the default search engine (Bing) that the Microsoft Edge Browser uses. A workaround is to navigate to the search engine of your preference then save that page in a tab and access it from the tab bar when you want to use it.Otherwise there is not that much in Windows 10s that hobbles the laptop. If you want you can upgrade (and later downgrade back to 10s) to the Windows 10 Pro version and have the full windows experience. Also keep in mind that in theory 10s should give you slightly better battery life. The reason given to me by Microsoft Tech is that 10s eliminates certain background processes from occurring which would normally occur with Windows 10 Pro. I've not noticed a measurable difference in my use of the laptop, but I assume that it will depend on what you've installed and how you use your Surface Laptop.Battery life for me is nowhere near the claimed 13.5 hours. Not even close. My previous Windows laptop got only about 3.5 hours so what I'm getting from the Surface Laptop exceeds that greatly. But still, it's not even close to 13.5 hours. On a good day I can eek out maybe 7.5 hours of use before I need to plug into power.UPGRADING TO WINDOWS 10 PRO: After a lengthy debate with myself I took the plunge and upgraded to 10 Pro. It took only 2 minutes. What prompted me to upgrade was another dumbed down feature of 10s that I simply could not live with. 10s does not allow you to access the Command Line. So you are not able to even run the battery test function unless you upgrade to 10 Pro. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Now that I have 10 Pro installed I will be able to definitively report back in a week or so whether it has degraded, improved or has no influence on my battery life.I found an awesome sleeve that I could recommend. It is the Lacdo 11-12"" sleeve and is quite nice, well padded and fits the Surface Laptop absolutely perfectly.Lacdo 11-12 Inch Water Repellent Laptop Sleeve Case for MacBook Air 11.6"" New Macbook 12"" Surface Pro 4 3 Asus Dell HP Ultrabook Notebook Bag, Black",0,2,3,2,4

1651,"Amazing product, the materials are great. Feels that it is a premium quality.The battery may disappoint you because in tech specs you can see that it will work 14.5 hours. As for me I couldn't get from it more than 8 hours.It may heat if you will play games, then you need some additional cooling.Also the screen ratio is 2x3 that is great for work. But for movies it may be not as wide as you would like.Touch screen is great, very responsible. To keyboard and touch pad there is no complaints.",0,2,3,2,4
1652,"There are many reviews out there that will tell you most of the intricacies of owning this computer, but there is a thing or two I did not see mentioned before so I would like to put it out for those few people who may find them important.To start politely, if you are looking for a laptop computer, you should seriously consider this one. It has all the potential you may want. It is just that it has limitations, too.First trivia about it is that the power button is located on the keyboard. It is between other buttons, not bigger and not smaller, just one of the buttons there. It is not even the one in the corner, it is the second one from the right in the top row. You will get used to it, but the choice of the position is unexpected, at least.Much more important to me is the fact that computer is practically barely usable unless you open the Microsoft Store account. It does not work straight from the box in the way computers should. Well, it will work with what comes preinstalled on it, but nothing else. A lot has been written about pros and deficiencies of Windows 10 S so I will skip those details, but you are not going to install anything on them without Microsoft Store account. Every review on every tech site will tell you that it qualifies for FREE upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and then you will be able to install programs the way you are used to with no limitations. Unfortunately, no website mentioned that Windows 10 Pro cannot be installed/upgraded to without Microsoft Store account. In case you thought that paying serious money to get a computer with operating system should be enough, you are out of your nave luck. You will be able to meaningfully use that same computer only if you join the Microsoft Store club from which you may not have any intention to ever buy anything. Where is the rationale for asking gender and date of birth to open an account for upgrading to the operating system you were promised you would be able to easily upgrade to after you paid for the computer is open to discussion.Aside of that Apple-esque idea, I think the computer may be good for those who have Microsoft Store accounts and do not feel fooled by not being able to upgrade without joining the club. For the rest of us, it is a machine that could, but failed to deliver due to pre-installed software limitations.Please note, reviews of the new computer are not of the feel of the buttons or softness of the Alcantra only. They involve preintalled software and ability to use the item without having to jump through the unadvertised hoops.",1,2,3,2,4

1664,"I, for one, LOVE this computer. I'm not going to pretend that the other reviews had me a little worried but I'm very glad I chose to give it a chance anyways.I bought this one to replace my basic HP Chromebook that I had for 3 years or so. I loved my old one. Just like it, this one performs astoundingly. Long battery life, charges fast, and restarts within seconds to update. I have a windows PC as well and I am really beginning to dread having to use that for anything. The updates are constant and take SO long. . . Although in reality, it's probably not that long, I'm just spoiled by the lightening fast Chromebook updates and startup.I absolutely love the tablet/laptop transition. Everything is extremely smooth and responsive. The incorporated pen is amazing and performs remarkably well. I was pleasantly surprised with the response time of the pen. The pressure sensor is pretty awesome.The remarks about the light up keyboard was an initial turnoff for me as I had a Mac book previously and I thought the lit keyboard was a must have. With my basic Chromebook, I was frustrated with the lack of the lit keyboard but my keys were also white with gray letters. . So the light from the screen was terrible for illuminating them. Since the keys on here are black with white lettering, the light from the screen reduces the need for a back lit keyboard. Even on the low end of the brightness spectrum. So, I like this better. I can still see the keys when I work late at night while my husband is sleeping and it's one less source sucking the battery juice.You can read other reviews regarding the technical specs of this device but it performs wonderfully. I've been very pleased and I'm on this thing most of the day doing school work.The best part, I saved for last. . These wonderful designers are my favorite because there isn't just one charge port, but TWO. . .One on each side so it doesn't matter what side of the outlet you situate yourself. Honestly amazing.Oh, one more thing. . My husband found this new service from Amazon where you can basically log in to one of their computers remotely for a small fee every month and utilize the features of a full blown computer. . We haven't tried it yet, but we went with another Chromebook instead of a standard laptop with the intention of trying that out. . So, you get the price of the Chromebook with potential access to a full blown computer!! Once we try it I will update on it's performance.",2,4,5,4,5

I feel some things are just, but not the fact they hid boot priorities. Nonetheless, great laptop! The screen is okay, but 1080p is really nice (I checked the display properties, it states 1920x1080).

This display is quite bright as well, so reading outside should not be a big issue.Touch screen: this has open made this chromebook much more usable, of course in combination with the ability to download and use Android apps (I'll get to that in a bit).Performance: the chromebook is snappy for what I use it for: web surfing, messaging, emailing, and streaming movies. It's not quite as fast as my Macbook Pro, but it's not quite as expensive either. If you need to do some serious office work, with two dozen browser tabs opened, and multi tasking with a bunch of applications, this is not what you want, nor is it designed for that. You can probably do some quick and light work with the Google apps (Google Doc, Google Sheet etc), I haven't tried that yet.Google Play Store: this is what really improves the usability of the chromebook. Before, you are limited to pretty much the Chrome browser, and a couple of Google apps and browser extensions. Now with the availability of Android apps, coupled with the touch screen, you can use the chromebook in many more ways. Not all apps from the Play Store work or work well, but I find the ones I use frequently work fine.Keyboard and touchpad: keyboard works well, reasonably springy and tactile. It's not the Macbook Pro's keyboard (the older one, not the new shallow one), but it's better than keyboards on many budget laptops. Keys don't require a lot of force to press either (less fatigue). Touchpad is responsive and seems to be accurate as well.Build: metal and not plastic, so there's not much creaking as in cheap netbooks.Weight: pretty light. The specs say 2.38 lb. My food scale showed 2.35 lb.The (-):Build: though it's metal, it's not as solid as I'd like. I can tell the different in build quality instantly picking up my old macbook air and this chromebook. It's not as solid as the macbook air. There's still a little flex and creaking, but not to the extend of cheap plastic laptops. The design and build also doesn't scream premium either (which it's not). No one will mistake this for $1000+ laptops.Keyboard: though the layout is mostly normal and fine, the diminutive backspace key is annoying (it's even smaller the the regular letter keys). I also prefer the lettering in CAP as most regular keyboards rather than lower case like this keyboard, though it's just a very minor complain.Web cam: I'd like it to have a little better resolution and works better in low light. So far it's the worst cam among all my devices when I skype.Price: at $420 (I got it cheaper than that buying an open box and with a $50 student coupon from Best Buy), it's relatively expensive for a Chromebook. I think $300 (or cheaper) would be a sweet spot.Summary: If you need a lightweight laptop/netbook just for surfing the web, checking you email, skypeing with your friends, watching your netflix, or occasionally work on your documents and excel spreadsheet, this might be a good alternative to cheap, low end Windows laptops. It's very adequate for that kind of usage, and I plan to get 2 more for my parents.* Updated 4/19/2017 *After using it for about 2 weeks, I've discovered some quirks, and deducting a star.- Not sure why, but Chrome on this laptop doesn't render some sites correctly (for example the WSJ's comment section).- When streaming directly from some website (for example CBS, ABC, or NBC), the video stutters, with jerky motions, unlike on other laptops. Strangely, it's smooth from other sites (Fox, etc). I don't like to use the apps because the apps are still lacking comparing to the website.I'm still keeping the laptop. Hopefully, future Chrome OS updates will bring improvements.",2,4,5,4,5

1693,"This Chromebook was to replace a Macbook Air from a few generations back as a development machine (using the Cloud9 IDE) - the setup is speedy and works well for the projects I have going. Furthermore, if I felt I needed more power, I could always install Crouton and run Ubuntu on the device.Overall, I've had a great experience with this machine. Chrome runs fast on this device (of course), and I have had nothing but a great experience with it! Google Play apps can be glitchy, but overall the experience has been fine. The stylus works wonderfully with Squid (formerly Papyrus) as a note-taking tool for classes. For some other apps (Evernote, possibly OneNote) it behaves a little more stiffly and can be a bit unresponsive.I'm concerned about the hinges as I do flip the laptop multiple times a day, but it remains to be seen if such fears are warranted. Thus far, 10/10!",2,4,5,4,5

1695,"First off, for about $750 I do not believe you can beat this at all. I am not totally sure what SSD was ""supposed"" to come with this unit but my unit came with an Intel 600p pci-e SSD, to me to have an SSD of that class is great especially at this price point, while it is not the best, its better than a sata version, it also came with 8 gb ddr4 2400 MHZ ram. The screen is not perfect but it is still very nice. To get a 1050 Ti 4 gb, a true 7th gen quad core, a 1080p IPS display, and usb-c it is top notch. This is by no means a high end gaming rig, that is what my Ryzen 7 and GTX 1070 are for. This is great for a second computer or work machine to get work done and being able to game on the go as well. Power, speed, and features wise, this is as powerful as most regular desktops, if you are in the market do not hesitate to buy this. In my opinion anything more powerful should probably be a dedicated desktop anyways",2,0,3,2,2

Decided to return because of the low memory errors.",3,4,5,4,3
1703,"I was looking to upgrade my old Acer Aspire, and I chose this model as a good budget option for basic home productivity use. Looking at the specifications for the computer, the components that I most wanted to change were the mechanical hard drive and the mismatched pair of DIMMs that will prevent operating in dual-channel mode. Fortunately, the laptop is designed to make both of those components easily replaceable.I replaced the HDD with an SSD and upgraded the RAM to an 8GB dual-channel kit. Before swapping out the HDD, I went into the BIOS, added a password, and disabled secure boot. I'm not sure if the password was necessary, but my last Acer laptop would lock out the HDD after a change unless the BIOS password was set, so I set the password on this one as well. The upgrade process was quick and easy thanks to the access panel in the back of the laptop. The SDD from the old laptop had an installation of Ubuntu 16.04 with the HWE stack, and everything worked well without making any new changes to the OS (I did have the minor workaround of changing the line ""GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT = quiet splash"" to ""GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT = quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor"" in /etc/default/grub already setup on my old laptop, so that may still be necessary for a new install). After the upgrades, the laptop seems very responsive to me. Of course, Ubuntu on an SSD is a very different setup from the laptop as shipped, so I really can't say what the user experience of Windows 10 on the HDD would be like.As others have commented, the screen is not the best, but it is good enough if you're not doing graphic design or gaming. Also, I don't understand the fuss about the lack of a backlit keyboard, as I don't look at the keyboard while I type anyway.",2,2,1,3,2

1708,"The little Chromebook that could, is what I call this item. I received one to test whenever I was deciding on what new hardware to deploy into my IT department. We use Gsuite and Chromebooks for our employees and are quite satisfied, however, we needed something extra. We turned to the Chromebook plus to fill our niche and it has surprised us all.This device is great for the person on the go. If you work inside web apps all day then this is your machine. It is light, fast and sleek! The screen is sharp and not too small, the resolution is just right, and tablet mode is great for reading. Day to day work task are easily accomplished(this is subjective depending on your type of work).The google play store is meh depending on what apps you use, some are great but others definitely could use some work, but it is in beta. The battery is somewhat lacking and can drain rather quick, mic and camera are decent but nothing to write home about, and the keyboard isn't the best for large hands.The Samsung Chromebook Plus is a niche product but what it does it does well. It provides amazing features at a great price and foot print. I would recommend to anyone who works inside of web apps all day, uses google gSuite, or is developer that uses AWS.",2,4,5,4,5

I wish that it charged like my Asus Chromebook: with USB Type-C; but I would guess it's because it uses more power than the connection can supply. Right out of the box I had an application for it: I installed Kodi with my Plex Add-on, then connected it to my TV Via HDMI and I was running home movies via my Plex server in less than 20 minutes.Like with any OEM laptop, there is some bloatware to it.

1746,"BACKGROUNDIm not that old but I got interested in computers early on. I was the first of my friends who owned a personal computer and one of the first owners of what could truly be called a laptop. Back then the name Dell conjured up an image of something kluged together in someones dorm room and it was years before I could take them seriously.Fast forward to today when Ive owned so many PCs Ive lost count and my personal laptop is a large-screen Dell gaming machine that may be the most advanced laptop Ive ever owned. Needless to say these days I have no issues when I hear someone say dude youre getting a Dell.This one is at the edge of modern technology and thankfully for me has what it takes to use in my business in a much smaller and lighter form factor than my big Dell gaming laptop and as a bonus adds a touch screen, which to me is more than just a trivial nicety, as a graphic artist and pro photographer when combined with a PN338M active pen they are big selling points.OBSERVATIONSIts true that Dell laptops may not be carved from a single piece of aluminum and there is extensive use of plastics, but it all comes together to form a surprisingly well built and sturdy machine. The keys feel tight and accurate, the track pad that tends to be misunderstood if you dont read how to customize it is better than average, and the 13.3 screen the ideal compromise between being big enough to be useful but small enough to keep the device small and portable - the entire laptop is not much larger than a sheet of paper and just over 3/4 inch thick.This laptop is the most lacking of status lights, switches or buttons Ive ever seen. There is literally only one status light at the front edge that illuminates during charging or when the storage drive is accessing. The on/off switch is on the exterior side and is a push to activate button, which unfortunately could be pushed accidentally, especially if you store it in a soft laptop case. The only other button is an external rocker switch for the volume control. In terms of I/O ports my opinion is that what they have is adequate but not impressive but for me its all I need.SPECSAs far as specs, they speak for themselves, it runs my most intensive photo/video editing apps without hesitation (note that the stock 8GB RAM is easily user upgradable, which I upgraded to 16GB myself in a couple of minutes).DOWNSIDESOne thing is that at 3.5 pounds its not the lightest but I can forgive that because it does feel more rugged than some if the lighter models. Another is the lack of an optical drive which is simply a fact of life today and other than being a minor inconvenience for people like me who do graphics work Id gladly give up the extra weight and use of space an internal optical drive would add.An observation that I wouldnt exactly call a downside but definitely distorted is that they say it has a sleek new design that emphasizes more screen and less bezel. No thats not true, what theyve done is extend the glass that covers the screen all the way to the edge purely for cosmetics but under that glass is a totally normal 13.3 screen surrounded by large borders and a very thick border at the bottom. They had plenty of real estate to actually reduce the size of the bezel and use a larger screen  but they chose not to.Speaking of design, the entire design philosophy of this laptop is that it can be used in multiple configurations. That sounds really nice on paper but in real life use it turns out to be not all sunshine and rainbows. When used as a typical laptop (on your lap) the two audio speakers are on the bottom and face right into your lap, muffling the sound. Even when on a desktop the sound is muffled. And the fan, the value of which is questionable since my much larger Dell laptop doesnt have one, and the one in this unit is weak, also faces downward into your lap. When you prop it up like an easel the keyboard faces downward on the desktop, supported by only four tiny rubber feet. The feet are all toward the top of the keyboard so if you press too hard when using the touchscreen the entire laptop rocks backward. When you use the laptop in a tent mode, there are no plastic or rubber feet along the edge that sits on the desktop (the front edge that faces you when used as a normal laptop). This doesnt cause any major problems except that that painted plastic edge is subject to a lot of wear and tear and eventually looks really bad. And finally, if you want to use it as a tablet, well lets just say it is awkward because any or all of your fingers that are holding on to the back of the unit are pressing against the keyboard, which is not a good thing for obvious reasons.I cant help but mention one particular flaw that it seems they could have done something about which is that their own preloaded update app isnt smart enough to know when Windows is in the process of doing an update (which is pretty often). This is especially true when your unit is brand new and the first thing Windows does is brings it up to date with endless updates that can last for hours. Unfortunately Dells update app doesnt respect that and barges in trying to do their own updates at the same time, the worst of which was just as Windows was finishing a major version update, they decided to flash the BIOS without asking me (which is a sensitive and major task during which absolutely nothing else should be running). This caused Windows to roll back and undo everything it took almost an hour to do. Im lucky that the BIOS update didnt fail and brick the entire computer. For them to permit such a conflict in software design is inexcusable.NITTY GRITTYI dont take sides when it comes to the PC vs Mac debate. I own both plus an iPad, and I use them daily. Both can be equally adept for people who work in the graphic arts with a lot of it boiling down to personal style and work habits. With all that in mind I have certain editing specialty apps that I want to use that are PC only and I have yet to finds a PC equivalent to my iPad Pro that lets me do pen based editing on a touch screen. This computer is that bridge for me and has enough power and resolution (not the best but good enough) that I decided to load it up with all of my photo and graphic apps and dedicate it as my personal workstation.SUMMARYIts biggest downside is how much it costs, it would be a strong contender at under 500 bucks but there are too many better options above the 700 buck mark that make you wonder what they were thinking listing it so high. One impressive plus is that this model has wonderfully easy and well documented accessibility for upgrading memory, storage, battery and just about everything else, something the pretty, trendy (and expensive) models from some other brands have as a strike against them.The unit Im I just got in early 2018 was made in late 2017 and is identified as a unit intended for Ireland and some of the user forums imply that it has already been discontinued. Its been difficult to verify that from the manuf because it is difficult to pin down exactly what the details are for any specific model from their info.If some of this sounds like I dont like it, thats not the case, it may not be as cutting edge as the price would suggest but the conservative design of Dell laptops has served me well previously and I have positive vibes that this one will as well. Sure this laptop rides at the upper end of the budget considering its specs but I think you get what you pay for, and dressed in that unique Theoretical Gray color it has the look of success written all over it.",1,2,3,2,4
1747,"I ordered this laptop and noticed it was running slower than it should, so I had a certified and licensed technician check it out. Turns out, the motherboard was bad, so I sent it back and asked for a replacement which couldnt be done, they could only send me a refund and I could reorder. By the time everything was done, I had my refund, and I was ready to reorder, the price for the laptop had gone up by $30. I called customer service and asked if there was anything that could be done since it was a problem that came right out of the manufacturer, and because I really did want this laptop, they said no because its being sold by a third party and there is no way for me to speak to the manufacturer directly as I have checked. Upon further inspection, this isnt even the same laptop that I had originally ordered. The specs have been slightly altered, there is no longer a SSD in this laptop, and its overall just lower quality than the laptop I wanted. So, in the end, I regret ever even considering spending money on this laptop and you shouldnt either.",2,3,1,2,2
1748,"Great buy! If you've never used an SSD before, the performance increase is immediately noticeable (assuming your OS is booting from it).

However, I am running games like Starcraft 2 and Command and Conquer 4 on maxed out graphics with absolutely no lag or frame rate issues. As for the newest games, I'm not sure the GTX 1050 will hold up, but this is still a solid gaming laptop and the SSD paired with the i7 processor provides for a quick and responsive experience.",1,0,1,2,2

1752,I hope everyone had a great holiday and this is one of my 2017 Holiday gifts to myself. As for background please check out some of my reviews I enjoy tech and have reviewed several types of systems. I brought this system for one purpose to match it with my Samsung Odyssey VR Headset for Windows mixed reality.From a price standpoint you would be hard pressed to find another Gamming Laptop in this price range with these features. I searched the net and the pricing was the best here on Amazon. I set up the laptop with the Samsung headset on Christmas and it passed all the test with flying colors I used it most so far to play Space Pirates an excellent VR game. I also have installed Star Trek Bridge Crew and Arizona Sunshine for non VR I have the Division on it running at full 60FPS. The laptop allows my VR to run at the full 90hrz on all my VR Games I can confirm mine does have the 1050TI not the 1050. The Laptop came with no bloat wear and was easy to setup by voice. I am certain the one I got has the drive holder for me to add an additional drive to the system I did not get it to use it on battery power for any long periods of time I understand these laptop are not made to game for hours on end with just battery powerEven with the speakers faced down I still get great sound from them and the screen being matt is a pleasure glossy screens are to me over rated. Start up time is very fast and if you want to really use this laptop you will need an additional drive the included 256Gigs will fill up fast. This is I think one of if not the best first Gamming Laptop you can get and still be under $1000.00 If you have the cash and can afford a $1000.00+ machine then go for it but for me this hit a very nice sweet spot and it means I can take my VR on the road to let friends play with it.,2,0,3,2,2

Apparently, you have to buy a separate policy to cover the adapter, which is good for Dell, since the adapter, made in China, is of very pull quality if it loosens apart after a month to expose wires. It is probably also dangerous. If you don't care about worthless warranties, go ahead and buy this computer, but not that Dell does not stand behind its products.

1777,Fantastic laptop! Runs most games i've thrown at it and it's easily upgradeable. I'm installing an SSD and running windows and apps off of it and using the included 1TB HDD as storage until i can get an SSD for storage as well. The battery life is excellent and it was almost entirely clear from the random crap most big box retailers slam into their off the shelf machines (removed the antivirus included as it doesn't hold a candle to avast).My major complaint thought is the trackpad. I really wish there were buttons on it instead of a click of the right or left side of the pad. I just can't get used to the tactile click vs having no button. I also have an issue with the power button essentially doing nothing. I wanted it to put the laptop to sleep but it doesn't do anything. Might be a software issue though.,2,2,1,3,2

I could still replace the HD in it but decided to buy this one instead. The reason for 4 stars is: The battery life is just OK at about 4 or 5 hours. The other issue is that the charging cord has a large heavy transformer on it adding extra bulk and weight. MSI has always used these and they need to come up with something smaller and lighter.

1780,"I purchased from a different big box store but I wanted to post my review here as most people come here first.Just a quick non in-depth but semi informative review :)First off, build quality on this is very nice and solid and the screen is amazing - not that you can really take full advantage of that resolution on such a small screen. The ""recommended"" resolution looks very good though. The pen worked well but I honestly didn't go too in depth with it. It worked as I would expect having owned phones from their Note series.Performance - Ehhh. Definitely a tad sluggish when in the play store and running android apps. I found that I had to exit out of chrome in order to do anything on the android side of things. What can you really expect from a core M3 though? I think for the most part, your average computer user should be fine with this. Also, if you do decide to go full on highest resolution with this, alot of the android apps arent going to work. Just a heads up.I had the laptop for 3 days, and every day it would reboot out of no where a few times. This may or may not be a software issue. This has been known to happen on several other chromebooks so take it as you will. I dont have the patience to wait it out so I returned it and grabbed a TabPro S (Completely different beast, I know)Battery Life in the 3 days I had it lasted about 8 hours on a charge.Oh and one more thing... Before you open the lid on the laptop make sure you take the plastic off that is on the hinge or it will make a loud cracking sound like you just broke something :)",2,4,5,4,5

Did ASUS not know this would happen? I have to believe they did. And I paid 200 dollars in /February, now they want $400 as of December 2017. What a horrible unethical company that will sell you a computer that won't even hold the OS.

I have set it up so it goes in sleep mode when not in use for more than 15mn unplugged and that it turn off the screen after 5mn.Intel 8th Generation i5-8250U CPU. Maybe but 1.6Ghz speed is fairly low.8GB RAM & 256GB SSD. One should add M2 SSD in fact.I installed a benchmark tool similar to the Win 4 performance tool and here is the score I got 7.3 out of 9.9The gaming graphics gets the max 9.9The processor and RAM get a solid 9.0 out of 9.9The Hard disk gets a 8.2 out of 9.9The downer is the dekptop graphic performance (Aero I guess) that gets 7.3 out of 9.9It is worth noting that the total score is defined by the lowest part.So what is it to like about it?- The weight. At 2.4 Lbs for a 15.6"" Laptop, this is wonderful.- The battery life: For once a laptop that could allow me a full in-flight use while flying to Europe.- The screen quality: IPS screen. I have not seen the response time for gaming but IPS is usually fast- Modulable: I have already opened it to install another M2 SSD drive of 500GB. It was fairly plainless. I unscrewed the backplate (9 screws) and that was pretty much all it took.- Micro SD port.- 3 USB 3.0 ports- 1USB-C port- One HDMI port- One headphone Jack plug (not one for Mic and one for headset).- Very good sound output- Very nice quality of image- Silent. Even with the processor at 100% speed, the noise level remained very low)What I like less:- I have not found the second port for additional RAM. So one may need to replace the 8GB by 16GB. This may be costlyIn conclusion:I was previously using a 11"" laptop to carry around and I decided to use this new one because it is lighter, more powerful and has a better battery life.

It is worth noting that both are M2 PCIe M Key and both did fit. The original HD was a M+B slot.You should be aware that one M2 port is PCIe Gen 3x2 and the other is a PCIe Gen 3x4. If you swap from M+B to M Key, the main driver is the empty slot. In clear, if you upgrade your drive, put the new drive into the empty slot, it will be the fastest.Now, the difference is not that dramatic but you will get the following:- About 2GB read/ 950MB write for the main drive.- About 1.8GB Read/ 800 MB write for the main drive.So now, my performance index for the HD has gone from 8.2 to 8.9...For reference, the original SSD was giving me about 55MB read/ 270 Write...What does it mean for an average user?

The keyboard does take some getting used to, but for the occasions I work from home or send a personal email, I have no major complaints. For my needs I probably could have gone with a cheaper device, but I'm hoping the Plus will last a long time and it's added features were a bonus to me.",2,4,5,4,5

It's attractive, with the space grey color. And the display is, quite simply, stunning. Some reviews have talked about the fan being noisy. Yes, you can hear the fan but it isn't overly loud. One would expect the fan to run to dissipate the heat in such a small space. The only thing I wish this model had would be an nvidia graphics card but the Intel 620 graphics works well.I'm very happy that I purchased this machine.",3,2,2,0,3

When my husband turned on the laptop to begin to load it the Microsoft Suite I had purchase, the laptop locked with a message from Microsoft that the computer had a virus in it and the Microsoft Key was not to be used in this computer. Now, my husband does not have his new laptop for Christmas because we are unable to open it, download a thing, or work with it. Microsoft now wants $400 <> from us to clear the computer. This computer came with this defect and we were not able to even do a thing to it. I also paid with my Discover card the bill which I had over $176.00 in bonus for using my card and if I returned the computer to you this money will disappear!

So I saw this and reading reviews figured it would serve my purpose....mainly that of reading digital books and looking around the net. This actually weighs less than my tablet and it will last a good 6+ hours on battery.

Let me clarify and say that I would get better clarity and color from a slide-projector out in broad-daylight. The 8gb of ram and Core i5 run slower than my Lenovo Tablet with a single core Atom processor and 2gb of ram. The good news is that if there is a flood in your area, you can stay afloat on the incredible amounts of bloatware that come with this. This laptop also claims to have an Nvidia GTX 1050. I'd let you know how it works, but so far it doesn't even recognize its existence and would rather use Intel HD Graphics. I BOUGHT A GAMING LAPTOP AND IT'S USING INTEL HD GRAPHICS!? Incredible! I must say Dell really outdid themselves on this one. I hope their team enjoyed all the time the took off during the development of this laptop, because this truly feels like a product designed in a few hours. Incredibly pathetic. This has to go back. Last Dell I own. Period.",1,0,1,2,2

It gives the illusion that it's alluminum, but it's plastic with a nice finish.Just a couple of small things that I can overlook, but are noticeable. First the touch pad doesn't have separate left and right buttons, it's all one pad. I typically leave my finger on the left click button and use my middle finger to move the mouse around. I found that when I operate it like that, it accesses a ""pinch"" feature and zooms in and out. The other thing that stood out to me is because it's so slim it makes it difficult to open.Overlooking those 2 small quirks, I love this laptop!",3,1,5,4,3

1867,"After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for. While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone's mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain? 2) is it worth the premium price? 3) why isn't USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design: The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL). This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy. You can open the lid with one finger. In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops. The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard. Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4's. It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors. Sounds wonderful. But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad. So, how long can alcantara last? A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time. Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards. Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard.""Is this worth all your beer money?"" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It's not that you can't get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time. Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range. Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn't a single comparable Windows laptop out there. I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience. In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure. This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain. Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store. When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet. Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go). To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn't Microsoft put in some USB-C ports? For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds). Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future. Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing. What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C. This creates a big headache for the consumer. If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work. More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A). In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of ""having something that works today"" vs. ""having something that will work in the future but probably not today."" It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port. In my mind, I'm okay with not having the USB-C port. USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I'm not very big on carrying multiple dongles. As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for: This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don't require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies). Engineers might want to double check their schools' recommendation before taking the plunge. If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you! I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier. I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.",1,2,3,2,4

The size is perfect for travel and I like how you can still access many of the applications and tools you need even without the internet.

1901,"Decent overall. 95% of what I do is just writing/word processing using Scrivener and google docs. On Scrivener, the words look slightly fuzzy. Maybe this is the thing with the screen not being amazing, but it's fine enough for me. Words and images look sharp and fine enough to me when web browsing or with other programs.This has twice as much memory as my old HP stream and a bigger screen (14 inch vs. 11 inch), also programs are working better with Windows 10 then the Windows 8. I can now sync my work with Google docs which did not work with Windows 8. I would have preferred to get a Chromebook but needed windows for Scrivener, and I wanted to spend the minimum possible--this fits the bill. I also like that this laptop is thin and lightweight for the plane. Hope it proves sturdy enough.One annoying thing--the power key is exactly where my old delete key used to be, and I use the delete a lot when writing. The delete key is tiny so I have to stop and look for it. A few other minor issues of getting used to a new keyboard. The computer itself runs fine.The only thing is the power cord is cheap. It will barely connect then it doesn't, and it won't stay plugged in. It's the cord that's the problem, not the computer itself. The cord for my former laptop fits in tight and charges fine (thankfully!), but as I'm passing that laptop onto a kid, I still need another cord.

1907,"Hi: I checked item described by seller as ""no"" for the following reason. The computer system was described as tested for functionality. But this is not a functional computer/system because the system cannot handle the Windows 10 OS. When I first received this computer and set it up I added Google Chrome, a Libre software package and my Samsung printer and of course set it up wirelessly with my modem/router and it worked. But as soon as the first window update occurred I starting receiving disk nearing storage capacity messages. I have had the computer now for about 1.75 mos and I have repeatedly received disk at capacity messages that tell me to save my work immediately, close and restart the computer and delete enough files from storage to free up adequate space for the system to function. I moved all of my personal files to my MS One Drive and cleared out anything pre-installed non-essential programs. Within little time it again reached the disk capacity. I have come to the conclusion that I will shortly be unable to use the computer at all, so I am returning it.

1917,"We have several tablets in our family, but this is actually the first laptop we have used in a few years. The Microsoft Surface Laptop combines some of the best features of a tablet, such as touch screen capability, thin and lightweight portability, and features like facial recognition software, with some of the dedicated laptop features that I have been wanting for a while, such as a permanent keyboard and touch pad. At less than three pounds, this really is a remarkable unit that boasts the power of a PC with the footprint of an iPad Pro.There are a few features here that I especially appreciate, such as the surprisingly soft textured keyboard cover that I was not at all expecting. Not only does the speckled gray color blend nicely with the laptop exterior, but it's easy on my wrist and fingers when typing or scrolling along the touch pad. Beyond the keyboard, which is much sturdier than the portable Bluetooth keyboards that I have used with my iPad over the years (that consistently fall apart after a few months), this responsive touchscreen works just as well as my iPad Air 2. It's very easy to shift from keyboard to touch pad to touchscreen depending upon what I am working on or trying to accomplish.Although I have not used many laptops in recent years, I found this unit to be very reliable and on point based on my knowledge of what is available in the market. The 8GG RAM makes this unit quite fast and responsive--in fact one of the best I have encountered on a PC. As with most modern laptops, the hard drive is solid state which allows for greater ease and reliability when travelling. The drive has 256GB which holds plenty of video, music, and document files. I use this to supplement my larger desktop computer at home, but it is perfectly functional and has the capacity to serve as someone's primary or only PC on a regular day-to-day basis.I am in a unique position in terms of brand loyalty because I have almost excessively been a Microsoft user in terms of computers while at the time only really using Apple mobile devices. There is definitely a convergence of styles here with this laptop. In fact, just looking at the white box with its minimalist, streamlined design, I could have sworn I was opening an iPad Pro or something similar from Apple. Even the charger is somewhat reminiscent of an Apple unit (although in black). If you are traditionally a MacBook user, I think you will find plenty to like with this Surface Laptop. All in all, I was very impressed and will make good use of this at home, in the office, and on the go.",1,2,3,2,4

I have been an active user of ASUS products, but this feels like an imposter to the company. The laptop stopped functioning properly only two months after its opening. I tried to sum it up to Windows 10 being the issue, but it is simply due to the fact that this is a poorly and cheaply made machine. It runs very slow and comes loaded with crap on it. It's shell is plastic and bends and creeks when used. It feels like a dollar store toy, it works, but it's not the real deal. I almost want to assume that this is a gimmick and ASUS didn't make it, but sadly they did. The ratings for this laptop have gone down from when I first bought it. Save your money and buy a better ASUS laptop, this is no way shape or form a ""pro"" laptop. Actually I recommend not buying computers from amazon due to the fact that they have a lot of issues with cheap stuff like this.

1955,"This is my third Chromebook since 2013 so I'm comfortable with the ecosystem and knew what to expect from Chromebooks in general - if you haven't used a Chromebook before you should do a little research first. My review is aimed at people who may want to trade up to this more expensive device.The first surprise with the Plus is how small and light it is in comparison to my previous Samsung and Toshiba devices. This really is aimed at a more premium market and deserves the higher price given the build quality. In tablet mode the device feels a little bulkier but still works well enough. I also have a very svelte Sony Z4 tablet but now find myself reaching for the Plus as often as that Android tablet.A great feature of this device is how well the Android apps work. I was expecting them to be a bit flaky but my usual apps e.g. Flipboard work very well (I switched to the beta channel so perhaps that helped). If you're interested in the Plus or Pro you probably watched the Verge review in early Feb and are aware of the stability issues running Android apps on the Pro but this is very far from the experience with the Plus.Apart from media consumption, I use this device for small-scale development tasks on remote servers via ssh so a good keyboard is important. This is not that keyboard. The single most disappointing aspect of this device is the cramped keyboard, the small keys with very short travel. It's an unpleasant experience even typing this much. For work I use Das keyboards so I am a bit spoilt but my previous Toshiba & Samsung chromebooks had more reasonable keyboards.The screen is amazing. The screen is amazing. Repeat. You really have to see it for yourself but do believe other reviewers when they praise the stunning colours and resolution. Although I'm never going to use the included pen much, it does work well for highlighting in presentations.In tablet mode, everything works well but don't expect that the experience will be as good as a dedicated tablet like the Sony Z4. The difference is that you can hold the Z4 in one hand for extended periods without feeling the strain, something which isn't really possible with the weightier Chromebook. The Plus is more suitable to sitting down with the device propped up on your knee. Less portable but still very useful and in this mode you really appreciate that gorgeous touch screen.All in all, if you are looking for a device to use casually as a tablet and still be able to get some work done then this device will delight you. Obviously you need to know the pluses and minuses of Chromebooks in general and expect that Chrome/Android integration is not perfect but with that caveat in mind, you can expect great things from this device.As a small aside, I imported this device to Ireland and the delivery was fast with all import duties paid at the Amazon checkout. You will need a converter for the American plug but luckily I had one at home and they aren't hard to pick up elsewhere.",2,4,5,4,5

Just turn on your laptop and look at the screen and your in. No messing with passwords or fingerprint sensor, its really fast like the password isnt even there.Only concern is the fan kicking in and machine getting pretty warm (79c), hoefully it doesnt become too much of a problem, but ive had this machine for a few weeks now and has only heated up twice.

1977,"This is an edit of my original 5-star review, below. I've now had the notebook for just over a year, during which time I used it as my primary laptop. I noticed some flakiness with failure to boot up once or twice, which apparently resolved itself each time, and otherwise didn't notice any real issues. However lately it has been working very slowly, and now it seems to have died for good. It simply will not start up, even though it's getting power. No way to do a hard reboot, as the battery can't be popped out and in again as on most laptops. No install disk, no instruction manual, and unless I take it for repair or delve into its innards myself I can't see what more I can do with it. I can't complain too much, since I only spent $200 on it and it's given decent service until now. But it would cost more than I paid for it to take it for a professional repair, and unless it again spontaneously recovers I suppose I'll have to write it off as a cheap (but cute) piece of junk that cost me, on average, $15/month for its year or so of service. It's mostly the inconvenience of having to scramble to come up with a replacement on short notice that annoys me. I'd still recommend it if it were available for the same price I paid for it, but it looks as though it's doubled in price since I bought it. Pro: great portability. Cons: small screen and no internal disk drive, not dependable. After this and other disappointing QC experiences with ASUS laptops, I'm going back to ACER.Original review: I travel abroad frequently, so it's important to me to have a decent basic laptop to carry with me that doesn't weigh much or take up too much space. All I need it for is email, web surfing, banking, video chatting, and streaming media. For that, this fits the bill on all counts--plus it is the only laptop in its class costing under $200. It's attractive, not hard to type on, and yes, the screen is smaller than my old laptop--but I got used to that quickly.

It was just like a dead machine.I would say when I turned it on in first place, the display was eye-catching but the brightness is only 250 nits at maximum. A lot of people complained about the flex in keyboard, to be honest, it was not a big deal. Likewise, the backlit on keyboard was more than satisfactory.Verdict: Its a mid-level laptop from Asus. I would recommend everyone to save some more bucks and go for some high end device e.g. Xps 13 or 15, Hp Spectre, Lenovo X1 Carbon.",2,2,1,2,2

Light, compact, has a Full HD screen (and the viewing angles are also great, despite being TN), and does all the everyday simple tasks, such as doing Office tasks, browsing a web, watching videos, or even play some very light games, such as Sonic Mania or Stardew Valley. Only issue comes from the limited storage of 32 gigs (it fills up very very quickly) and only 4 gigs of ram (multitasking, or even having 2-3 programs at once is barely possible, Windows 10 really requires at least 8 gigs). Still, I would say it's the best in its' price range.",3,4,5,4,3

2003,"I love the form of this machine but the wireless internet is not working and I only get about 2 megs per sec down and upload. I even went to the library this morn to try their internet and it was the same. I wanted to be sure that that it was not my router. There may be settings in the device manager that have to be changed but I have purchased enough laptops that have worked out of the box that I do not want to have to fuss with this. I have four other laptop in my home and the wireless is very speedy. . I could not even download the adobe flash update.There are wonderful reviews and I expect that if the wireless card is ok then all will be well.UpdateFebruary 23, 2017I returned my first laptop and Amazon sent me another. Sadly, the wireless card on this machine also did not work. The download speed varies from 2-10 mgper sec while the upload is the correct 26 megs. I have checked the speed with three different browsers and indifferent homes and the local library. I have updated the driver and changed the settings/options of the particular driver in the device manager.Asus support did respond to my one star review and I did follow their instructions. I have seen many comments on the internet about this particular wireless 802.11A/C and people seem to have problems with the card in their devices. One suggestion was to disable bluetooth since there may be a conflict with the wireless card but this did not help. Another suggestion was to make changes with my router but I must be able to connect to the internet in other locations, not just my home. I have kept the computer for two weeks, investigating and I think that there may just be a flaw with the card rather than the laptop and router settings.Since I like the laptop so much, I will wait several months and try one more time to see if perhaps I can receive a machine that will have a working wireless card.",3,1,5,4,3
2004,"Update: If I could leave ZERO stars, I would. This is a piece of CRAP! 2 months later and it no longer recognizes the SD card from my camera.

I purchased this laptop as a backup for my desktop of 4 years that had been acting up. I made the mistake of getting rid of the original packaging the second day because at first, it seemed like a great laptop. The third day of use, I noticed that it was slow loading websites or when I was clicking from one item to another. The fourth day, I had to do a hard shut down because the computer locked up and even pressing control/alt/delete did absolutely nothing. When I restarted the computer after the hard shut down, it took TWO HOURS to load updates and continued to operate in slow mode. I have had this laptop for 5 weeks now and I've had to do another 2 hard shutdowns due to it locking up and now, it does this scrolling on it's own thing where the screen kind of bounces around.

But for how long?This looks like it has been through a battle. Top part is much whiter than bottom/keyboard part. Deep, visible scratches above the power button and escape on keyboard.

We currently have 3 iMacs, 3 MacBooks, and 2 iPads. I'm done with Apple's daily updates, lack of innovation, and admitting they intentionally slow their machines ""to save the battery"". Are they so wonderful to help us? This Chromebook costs less than half of a MacBook Air. RIP Steve Jobs",2,4,5,4,5

It's super light, long lasting battery, and has a sturdy case. It is a bit light on features. No auto dimmer or backlit keys. I have found that the pop up keyboard in tablet mode usually works fine for in house Google apps but covers the bottom of the screen on most others... which is unfortunate because you can't see what you are typing.It's nice having access to the app store. I wouldn't have picked it up otherwise. However, Microsoft Office apps are ""not compatible with this device"" but Outlook, OneDrive and Remote Desktop are. Can't we all just get along? If you are google docs only you will be in heaven. I had to download another app to modify my files inside Dropbox.

2044,"Computer seems nice, I just wish I could use it. Upon starting it up and getting my account connected it started to install windows updates, and failed repeatedly. It got to the point where it said it was ""preparing to upgrade"" and was stuck at 9% for hours. Currently been working on this for 12 hours total. It would not let me modify/install other programs while it was stuck so I couldn't just live with it either. I tried restarting the computer and the update status never changed, right at 9 % when the computer was turned back on. Currently doing a reset process just so I can get it working at least, hopefully I won't just be restarting another 12 hour process. Should not have to spend this much time right out of the box just to get it to run, quite infuriating. If the current patches are problematic could this computer not be shipped pre-updated?As I said before, it seems like it would be a nice computer if it just ran like it's supposed to.Edit 1:Still unable to get most recent version of windows running, but am running stable at an older version. May have to try a clean install of windows but I'm not looking forward to getting all the drivers this thing needs back on it if I do. Additional issue, the track pad has terrible drift. About 10% of the time when I click while I still have my finger on the track pad, it causes the cursor to shoot across the screen without my finger on the pad moving at all.Strongly considering returning at this point. Highly disappointing for a nearly $2000 laptop.",2,0,1,2,2

However I have a lot of issues with this thing being touted as Android ready. Every android app runs terribly and freezes continually. Overall the thing feels like a beta tester model, but I will have to reserve my 1 (or 5) star review for when Nougat releases.",2,4,5,4,5
2047,"EDIT 12/02/17-- I have returned this item to purchase the next model up (i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and a 256 GB SSD). While the base model was fast and was fine with my normal tasks, I couldn't get over the 4GB of ram at this price range. I returned the laptop because I'm afraid that a few years down the road, this won't be enough memory to last. I purchased the next model up from microsoft's website as it was on sale. For an extra $200 I get the better, mid-tier, model and peace-of-mind with the 8GB of RAM and the bigger hard drive. I highly recommend that if you're going to spend this much money, save up a little more and get the mid-level surface laptop.To preface, I bought this computer at my local best buy for $900, and it came with a microsoft Arc bluetooth mouse (it's awesome). I purchased the base model with an i5 processor, 4 gb of RAM, and a 128 gb SSD. I bought this laptop because the look of the computer really struck me. As for the internals, at $900 you could probably get a better laptop. The processor so far appears to be good, and the SSD is blazing fast.The only thing that concerns me, is the 4 GB of RAM. Only having chrome open, with two chrome tabs the memory is already at 50% usage in task manager. I didn't buy this laptop to be a work house and do crazy video editing or gaming, I bought this to do simple things like browse the internet.The screen is insanely clear, I compared this to my macbook pro retina early 2015 and I actually prefer this screen over my mac. The keyboard is nice to type on, and the audio/sound of the laptop is more than adequate. The laptop itself is very light and easy to move, it reminds me of a macbook air.I'd say that, if you are considering this laptop, do your research and know what you're getting into. It's an expensive computer, but it looks DAMN good. If you only plan to use this laptop to use chrome and do other basic tasks, I would recommend the base model.P.S. None of these computers have scalabilty. Meaning you can't purchase more RAM or a bigger hard drive and install it.",1,2,3,2,4

The screen is very bright nice and crisp. Light weight and reasonably good battery life.The only problem is the trackpad lagging. If you come from Macbook you will be really frustrated. When you drag slowly the response is very slow. You have to exaggerate the drag first to get the pointer response properly. The double tap click is not 100% reliable. Even the regular tapping is not response many times. I also miss three finger dragging in Macbook which is very handy.The touch screen can compensate to some degree but the touchscreen reliability is only 95% with your finger. The pen is really the best but the productive programs like Google Doc are not support it yet.For Android part, I only tried the Hearthstone. The game performed well enough though FPS is reduced in some animation. The unreliable touch screen made me miss played my card on many occasion. This is where I found the Pen become very helpful (bonus is it make you look like working)I bought this or another vendor but they didn't let me post what I thought about their product.",2,4,5,4,5

The i3-7100U is not powerful enough to support high end gaming on high resolution however on lower resolution there is minimal lag.The case is no frills but I have not had any problems with it.

The only personal adjustment I had to make was the sound as this one is Dolby and the HP was DTS Studio (which was better), but other than that, I have no complaints. The AMD works just as well as Intel and I am actually able to save files on the Desktop without the HP Notebook telling me storage is less than 500mb. I do however, recommend iCloud or Google Drive as it is a good backup in the event anything happens to the laptop.

I highly recommend you change the HDD for an SSD or you'll be pulling your hair ( I'm getting bald BTW)",1,4,1,3,2
2091,"The laptop arrived,The looks would probably get a 3/5. It's somewhere in the middle of a cheap laptop, with some accents found on more expensive models.But the built quality and design, is similar to $300-$500 laptops.Like mentioned, the viewing angles of this screen isn't the best, but if it's just for you, sitting in front, it's quite ok!I like how they re-assigned some of the Fn keys (vol and screen brightness) to the cursor keys, instead of your standard number or F-keys.The speakers sound very nice for a laptop of this kind.It comes with only 2 hours worth of uninstalling crapware, vs the 8 hours of prepping I'd do on most other laptops.Mostly just the crap that comes with Windows installation, Firefox, a trial for Norton AV or something, and some Acer specific software that really doesn't serve any purpose.The weakness of this device is definitely the slow harddrive, that results in a laggy device. Upgrade to an SSD ($60-120 more), and this device should work quite well!That, and the screen, which has poor viewing angles. However, if you're the only one using it, the screen looks quite good. It's definitely bright enough for indoor usage. The colors are ok. They say 'wide gamut', but because the blacks aren't really black, it looks more like a cheaper TFT screen.For the rest, I had no problems with wifi, browsing, gaming (does well up to 1080p).The RAM is supposedly upgradeable to either 8 or 32GB, but 6GB is really more than you need for day to day usage.For the price, it's a great device, that blows older professional laptops of 10x the price, out of the water (performance wise).It probably will serve me well for the 4 to 6 years of the lifetime of a laptop. (No reason to go with a more expensive Asus or Sony that will outlast this laptop for 4 years, when you only keep laptops 4 to 5 years max).My guess is, this laptop will outlive Windows 10, and that's a good thing!",2,2,1,3,2

It's very lightweight which I love, small and was very easy to tote around when traveling during the summer. The battery life is fantastic. This, however, is what I would call a ""quirky"" device. The mouse track pad is very sensitive, so I plug in a wireless resolving the issue. It does not like being put in sleep or rest mode, I find the screen does not want to turn on after waking, I always power off. Don't hope to store much, get a micro SD or USB drive. It's an OK PC, I use MACs at work, making it a strange transition, but if you just need it for basic web surfing, basic documents, it's a handy little laptop.",3,1,5,4,3

After fixing that, it has started having overheating issues when I play games like Skyrim or Starcraft 2, and it has frozen up several times, which I've traced to the hard drive and/or ram running at 100%. Still a good computer for the price, but after these issues I would definitely recommend adding the extra ram card and HDD in the hopes that they would fix these problems. Fortunately these parts are accessible through hatches in the back, so I will be adding them as I am able.",2,0,3,2,2

I took this to a hackathon and at one point I was away from my charger and it lasted in power save mode for at least 3-4 hours after it got below 25%. It would have lasted longer but I plugged it in as soon as I could.The screen is awesome. I noticed a lot of the reviews before I bought this complained about the screen being too dim but for me its perfect.

Overall this laptop is very good. I haven't played a ton of games but what I have & seen is running things like overwatch & Minecraft & some other games it runs good at high settings but starts to dull down when running at ultra but still runs well, Minecraft though runs at fully maxed settings with max draw distance with 100 fps.",2,0,3,2,2
2143,"I bought this because I was starting a business. It booted up right away and I didn't have any problems going through the Microsoft Windows setup process with Cortana. A little annoying that Cortana wants to yap at you and I'd rather just go through the process quietly. Once started, I found it to be fast.My biggest concerns for this were the 256 GB SSD and the only 8 GB of RAM. So far I've seen no problem with the RAM. And the SSD operates with good speed as the system boots up from a dead shutdown in probably 20s or less. It wakes from a state of shutdown to the Windows security screen in about 10 seconds,which is faster than a Dell laptop I use for my day job.Overall I'm pretty happy with this. One issue: it had Office installed on it, and I was pleased with that, but then it expired avfter 30 days and I realized I still had to buy it. I couldn't get around the necessity to create an account with Microsoft, which is very annoying. I don't want an account with Microsoft and I have no desire to be owned by them any more than I have to. It was irritating to have to buy a downloadable $130 license to Microsoft Office after I already spent nearly $600 on this. I wish they were more transparent about it.Lastly, HP has a pesky background ""assistant"" that they install on all their computers. I also have an older home ""all in one"" PC that is an HP product and the assistant software really bogs it down. I uninstalled all of the unnecessary HP nanny-ware and the computer seems no worse for the wear as a result.",2,4,3,2,2

I'm a professional photographer and intended to utilize this machine when I'm out in the field. This laptop display is absolutely horrible. The color accuracy is atrocious, and the viewing angles are also terrible. My 5 year old Samsung display blows this machine out of the water. I tired contacting msi tech support which is basically non-existent, and completely worthless trying to see if there was a solution for the display. I received lots of canned response which I performed all with zero improvement. I also suspect that this machine won't last due to its cheap poor construction. It's a cheap all plastic build and the monitor hinges are very poorly made. Lots of flex across the board, even when placed on flat surfaces. This machine also has an abundance of fan noise even under light load. The machine is snappy and ran smoothly but the display was a deal breaker for me. I really wanted to like this machine but ultimately it's getting returned. I'd recommend spending a little more money and getting something other than this machine.",2,0,1,2,2
2157,Absolutely disappointing. Ordered Used-Like NEW from Amazon Warehouse. The look and feel was good but the bad experience started with the first push of button. The Laptop got stuck between the windows start up screen and boot screen. It started restarting in an infinite loop as soon as the boot was completed.

Sent back in original packaging and after repaired it arrived god awful package and none of the manuals and paperwork that came with it. It took three customer reps to even listen to my problem. I hope nothing goes wrong with it because they didn't return warranty info or anything else that came with it.,3,4,5,4,3
2172,"First, I purchased this product at a local Big Box retailer, not on Amazon. I don't think that matters, but I will note that.The Chromebook idea is a good one in my opinion. However, it is too limiting to be useful for _my needs_ at this stage in the game. From printing to app support - it is a bit of a wasteland. That said, the ability to run Android apps was one reason I picked this unit up. However, given the state of Android apps on ChromeOS - you are likely not going to bother. Office365 for instance, something that I really wanted to work on this unit - simply does not work. Microsoft won't allow you to download it from the Play Store on the device - probably because the screen size exceeds what Microsoft allows you to run Office for free. But I have an Office 365 account - and I couldn't find a way to get it on there. Anyhow, given how some of the other Android apps run on the device (that is, poorly) - I am not sure I want to bother.The build quality on the unit is questionable at best - under the screen glass there is a ripply looking plastic strip that looks extremely cheap. The hinges are cheap looking and the keyboard is barely acceptable for a device of this price. This is not a $250 Chromebook - it is almost $500 after taxes! For that price, there are lots of decent options out there.The stylus is rather on the flimsy and cheap side as well. It doesn't write particularly well, especially if you are used to a Surface Pen or an Apple Pencil.The OS is not that touchscreen friendly. Sometimes I would be playing a Youtube video in Chrome and it was a pain to use the 'scrub' control - it would sometimes misdetect where I put my finger. These are the same kinds of issues that using Chrome on Windows 10 on a touch device has. So while ""tablet"" mode sounds appealing at first - soon it became an exercise in frustration.I installed Linux via Crouton which is a very cool exercise by the way. This almost clinched it for me - but due to the ARM processor some software doesn't have native packages and you will have to recompile them yourself. Life is too short to waste on a $500 Chromebook that does less than most mid-range Windows PCs or used Macs. The ARM processor causes some sites to lag a bit compared to Core based Intel processors. I believe the Chromebook Pro has an Core M3 processor but is not out yet.If all you do is browse the web and do light productivity tasks - this machine might work out for you. But I almost wish that Google hadn't released the Android Play Store until it was completely ready. Because it is starting to smell like other Google abandoned projects at this point that will never work quite right.Skip this one unless you are happy having a dedicated Chrome computer. I might come back to revisit this in a year to see where they are. There are many good things about ChromeOS - long battery life, no maintenance, instant wakeup, etc. This unit is a rarity in that it has a 3:2 screen which I prefer for doing productivity work and web browsing (particularly in portrait mode).But this unit paired with ChromeOS is just too expensive and buggy for what you get. If it were $300 I think this would be a five-star product. But given that it is priced to compete with mid-range laptops and iPads, it is difficult to recommend. If you want a Chromebook there are many cheaper options.",2,4,5,4,5
2173,"honestly one of the worst pieces of hardware i've ever dealt with, i have had nothing but negative things to say about it. i can throw it farther than i could make any progress with it. it comes with windows 10 optimized for tablets but its not even touch screen. i've only been using this as an oversized coaster recently. spend a little extra for a full sized laptop, you'd be better off than this piece of garbage.",3,1,5,4,3
2174,"It's been about two months since I've had this laptop and I feel like I've had enough time learning and reviewing it so heres my review:Pros:- i7-7700 HQ Quadcore CPU up to 3.8ghz- Nvidia 1050ti with 4GB DDR5- Both an SSD and HDD (Although you can always add these yourselves, it was nice to have come with both)- Cooling system is one of the best Ive seen so far (Includes an Ultra-Boost button to give you extra cooling, but never needed to use it.)- Fan disperses air away from the back screen of the laptop, rather than the side of the keyboard. (I prefer this design better)- Red Backlit keyboard (Color cant be changed, but I wasnt specifically looking for a flashy laptop so this is just a plus)- Overall Matte Black texture around the laptop with pleasing MSI dragon logo on the back screen.- AntiGlare Screen- Num. Pad keyboard- Comes with 1 year manufacturer warranty(US) (You'll have to activate it online yourself.)Cons:- Although aesthetically pleasing, the Matte Black Plastic Finish is a FINGERPRINT/OIL magnet and takes more than just a dry cloth to remove- 8GB RAM (I intend to add on another 8GB stick in the nearby future)- Battery life is ridiculous when playing games- Fans are REALLY loud when playing games (Not much of a problem if you wear headphones, and is expected as it does a splendid job keeping the laptop cool)- Speakers are subpar (Again, not much of a problem if you wear headphones)Overall, I was in the market specifically for a laptop that had a good CPU/GPU, and both an SSD and HDD. I stumbled upon many competitor laptops along the same price range however, some were missing an SSD or HDD, or had the regular 1050 GPU which comes with only half (2GB) of dedicated memory of what the Ti model has (4GB). If I had purchased those laptops instead, and added on a separate SSD OR HDD, the total cost spent would be above $1000. The laptop is surprisingly light for a gaming laptop, and comes in a sleek yet aggressive theme, which wasn't what I was in the market for but is a plus to me. Most people who game on laptops would know that you get better frames while plugged in to the charger (This is due to bottlenecking of either the CPU or GPU demanding more power, yet the battery cannot provide that power alone), so the low gaming battery life is not much of a problem considering you should be plugged in to get the best performance, and the battery life outside of gaming is average (4-6 hours) depending on what work you'll be doing. Ultimately, the laptop met more than my needs and was in my price range ($899, $960~ after taxes), and I expect to be using it throughout and well after the years of college.",2,0,1,2,2

I was hesitant to get a laptop, but I was pleasantly surprised. The graphics and audio are amazing and flawless. It plays League of Legends, Minecraft, Rust, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and more on high settings. This was really worth every penny.",2,0,3,2,2
2182,Didn't realize it only comes with 32gb of in bedded hard drive space. Ran out of space real fast and had to buy an external 1T SSD. Also added an external DVD drive since it didn't have a built in one. I might have been smarter by purchasing a lap top that had all this with it. It works great now.,3,4,5,4,3

My old HP died and I knew Id have an impossible time replacing the nice keyboard and design of the lap top itself, which was comfy, fluid, etc. This is a very good purchase for me. I have too many other expenses to spend more. Picture and sound great. Called support number for a refresher on a few things.

After I looked at it, the screen flashed windows 98' then went to a screen stating the volume c had no label and did show a storage amount of 2gb. I thought that maybe that I needed to find the hidden partition on it so I can reformat the notebook. But due to there was windows 98 on it I could not find the hidden partition. This was horrible by and even though it was a recertified item I would figure they would have seen the windows 98 splash screen to show that something was not right with this device.

2196,"The Samsung Chromebook Plus is almost perfect for me. The only things missing are GPS, backlit keyboard, and a second camera to take pics while in tablet mode. The pen isn't the S-Pen that I am used to from the Note series phones, but it works. I like the keyboard/touchpad layout, similar to a regular laptop, but it is chiclet keys. They have a good typing feel, though. The screen is nice and bright, and wonderfully detailed.The reason I bought the product was because I needed to be able to take notes in class (writing), type up papers and such, and maybe play a few games. Unfortunately, the S-Note app from Samsung Note phones isn't available (um, Samsung? Please?), but there are similar Android and Chrome apps available. Thanks to the active pen, I can write on the screen without my hand making errant marks on the screen.The battery life is excellent, and it can go from 0% to full in about 2 hours. It uses USB-C, and there is a connection on both sides of the device. The plug that comes with it is hard wired, but it will charge with a cord and charger block too.All in all, I love my new chromebook, and I would recommend it.",2,4,5,4,5

I cannot update my computer due to a lack of memory so keep that in mind.2. If you have too many programs and windows opened it will lag! What I mean by too many is windows word (with 2 files opened), google browser with 5 + tabs, and another windows open, trying to look for another file.overall, it is great for what it is.

2210,"My daughter was so looking forward to this Chromebook as it has a lot of great features. She really liked the touchscreen, the integrated stylus, and the convertible screen that can turn it into more of a tablet. We did learn that the OS is quite different than what we're used to but we figured it out okay. The downside: in less than two weeks she managed to crack the screen, which is glass. Didn't even take much to do it, either, but since it's the screen, it is not covered under the warranty. Since this is a higher end Chromebook, we looked into repairing it. They manage to make every manner of screen replacement that can be purchased online and installed on your own, except for this one. I called Samsung and it's basically the cost of the unit to get the screen repaired. If that weren't the case, I'd give it another star but making something that is basically disposable if anything happens to the screen is a bummer. So word of caution: get the extra warranty!! If for no other reason than to cover the potential (and likely if this is going to an elementary aged kiddo) screen cracks. As for us, we'll be replacing this with a regular laptop.",2,4,5,4,5
2211,absolutely amazing. can use it for school and with the right programs can run most games so if you're researching what computer is good for gaming and school work at a low price this is definitely the laptop for it.

2214,Bought this for our office computer which only needed to get emails and check backgrounds on the web. Would defiantly recommend for anyone wanting an inexpensive way to surf the web. It's like an Android tablet with a keyboard and large screen. I think this is an excellent value.,2,2,5,4,3
2215,"After the screen on my HP laptop died I bought the exact same laptop. I was that happy with it. After a few years that screen died and then the keyboard died. No more HP laptops for me. Would love to have a Thinkpad, but that's to much $$$ for the likes of me.This Lenovo Ideapad meets my needs perfectly. I'm use to Windows 7 so there's been a little bit of a learning curve when it comes to doing things and finding stuff, but that was to be expected. I'm not a gamer and I wouldn't recommend it for a high end MMORPG but obviously that's not what I bought it for. I browse, shop, email, occasionally stream a movie, create documents and spread sheets. I also run the PLEX media server on this guy and have no issues using the PLEX app on my Fire Stick TV to pull movies stored on my laptop to watch on my TV. More than enough machine for me.The only issue I've had is printing. Sometimes it's unable to send printouts to the printer. Everything is setup correctly and the printer receives tests fine, but out of the blue it suddenly can't print from anything. I can still send a printer test fine. Network is fine. Default printer has current drivers and is fine. Trouble shooter can find no issues. I fix the issue by shutting down, powering off and rebooting. I suspect this is a Windows 10 issue so I didn't remove a star. Never had the issue with Windows 7.I installed the free for everyone LibreOffice rather than trialing the expensive Microsoft Office. I've used it for years and it more than meets my needs. There's not much bloatware. Some low end games and Microsoft stuff - mail, messaging, maps and such - that I don't use and uninstalled. I've been a Firefox fan for years, but I'm trying to give Microsoft Edge a chance. Final decision here will probably be based on available add-ons.I notice a lot of reviews complaining about updates taking so long. Truthfully, mine didn't seem to take that long. Besides, how is that the laptops fault? Windows needs to be immediately updated for any PC you buy and then continue to get updates periodically after that. That first update is always a big one. I live out in a rural area and on a good day my network download speed is a whopping 6MB. That is not a typo. I have no problem getting updates done or streaming movies. That said, if I'm doing some kind of big download then other things I'm doing do tend to slow down, but remember - 6MB bandwidth plus three of us in my home are using the internet at the same time. I also make sure nothing updates automatically. That includes all applications and Windows 10. Nothing more irritating than trying to do something and then some automatic update starts in the background and slows everything down or even makes your laptop seem to lock up. I just manually check for and start updates when I find it convenient to do so. I can but don't schedule auto updates to happen in the wee hours. Neither do I allow anything to send usage statistics or any other information up to its creators. Waste of bandwidth and computer resources. Something else I've noticed. Don't think I'm crazy. I don't know what it's doing, but if I leave my browser open to Amazon then my laptop - any laptop I've had - seems to run slower over time. I tended to leave it for days on end until I figured out what was going on. I resolved this by just not leaving my browser open on Amazon or at all for that matter.Sometimes products have defects. It happens. When I bought my brand new Jeep ten years ago the electronic sway bar disconnects didn't work. How did I feel spending over thirty grand (all the bells and whistles) and it didn't work right? It took three frustrating trips to the dealer to get it fixed. On my third trip I made them replace the whole system. Fixed. I still drive that Jeep today. I like this laptop. It works great for me. I can easily recommend it for the casual user. I'll resolve that minor printing issue. Just know the specifications, know what you're buying here, know what you plan on using it for, have realistic expectations and you'll be happy.",1,4,1,3,2

2217,I cannot get my screen to work on my laptop I was told that this was a brand new laptop and found out that it was refurbished when it was sent to my house and now I need to find out how to return it because it is honestly not working at all,3,2,5,4,3
2218,"First gaming laptop I bought ever, first laptop in like 10 years. Did I need one? Nope, but I wanted something I can use when I'm away from my desktop gaming pc.Specs wise, it's not bad, a gtx 1060 MAX-Q with 6gb of vram, that alone is something to consider as I looked around there isn't anything at this price point with this gpu power. Most laptops in this price bracket either run a 1050 with a slightly higher or same cpu or older 9 series gpu. The ram is garbage, 8gb isn't enough with win10 and gaming nowadays, and it's using 2 slots, would be better if it was 1 stick of 8gb so you could get another 8 stick. CPU power is probably on the weaker side with any of the top end games if you want to run past medium settings but for casual gaming it's usable.The build quality is for me, solid. Though I have slight bleeding on the screen, I don't notice it during normal usage, and there's some warping on the build that kinda bothers me but doesn't hinder function. No dead pixels for me. I don't have a problem with the keyboard, it's a laptop keyboard and I can always plug in my keyboard from my pc.The minor gripes I have with this comp is the way intel gpu and nvidia gpu is used, disabling intel gpu entirely makes the comp running really unstable, and when it's not plugged in to an outlet I feel like the nvidia gpu doesn't kick in in games. I haven't tinkered with the settings enough to figure out when and how it transitions but destiny 2 runs, overwatch runs, so I have no idea how I feel about it.This is a budget gaming laptop, keyword being budget, so it can be quirky but it's a fantastic deal imo and with the gpu market still taking a hit from cryptocurrency, getting a prebuilt pc or laptop seems a lot better than paying 900+ for a gtx 1080....It runs Nioh, Witcher 3, FFXV at medium settings, the specs sits at minium requirement, upgrading the ram, and possibly adding/replacing the ssd with a bigger one would improve overall performance and storage (the 5400rpm hdd is meh). I will get to it in the near future atm it works fine for what I need.",1,0,5,2,2

For our needs, just paying bills, surfing the internet, it seemed like this might be worth a try. So far we've been very satisfied, it's fast and slim. Knock on wood, hopefully it lasts a long time and we will forever be Chromebook people.",2,2,5,4,3
2221,"Excellent computer for the price. Consider this recommended specs for a successful windows 10 experience in my opinion. The hardware inside hits all the requirements for a good windows laptop without overkill parts.

It is a great in between for those that need the basics but want more than a Chromebook.It provides a large amount of storage space-I ended up with around 420 after with Windows and other pre-installed programs already built in. There is also a slot for a SD card if you need/want more space.While DVD/CD drives are becoming a thing of the past, it is nice to have one built in this unit and I consider this a huge plus.If you travel a lot like me, you might want to go with a smaller screen as a 15 inch screen can be difficult to pack and carry along as you go.The only complaint I have(so far) is the quality of the track pad.

2236,"I have been an ASUS user for many years and there are still two in the house - my wife's 15.6"" and my old 13"". In my search I found that Dell offered more features for dollars spent. No issues right out of the box :) The setup took just a few minutes. However, the Windows 10 Home updates along with a few hardware and BIOS update took HOURS. OK ... just have some patience. Once that was done, I ran the Dell SupportAssist which took only a few minutes. The keyboard has a nice feel and is responsive. The touchpad isn't quite as sensitive as my ASUS, but more than acceptable. There were professional reviews that the touchscreen was not up to par. I find no lack of response. The fan is very quiet and unit seems to be running very cool, an issue I had with my ASUS.The case feels a bit ""plastic"" which it is of course, and has a rough texture, which if you want to skin it, you may have an issue. A nice feature is that you don't have to remove the back if you need to replace the battery. An issue with my ASUS which is one reason for a new system, - batteries lasted less than a year. Not sure what life expectancy will be here - hopefully much better. It has a fair use time of 5 hours, which with the ability to replace the battery without removing the back is a big plus if you have need to be hours without AC.It has a more than adequate HD at 2tb, and RAM at 8gb (upgradeable). The i5 7200u processor is not the fastest on the market, but at this price point is a great value. This is not a gamers system, but I understand that it can do a fair job with many games. Keep in mind that this is a NEW unit, not a refurbished. There were a lot of refurb with less features for the same dollars and more.The seller, Trivalley, has the best rating of any Dell and HP laptop sellers on Amazon. They were a few dollars more than other sellers, but their customer service before the sale was excellent. I contacted them 6-8 times via email with various questions which were all answered promptly and completely.All in all ... Super pleased with the Seller, the laptop, and Amazon.EDIT: There is an issue with warranty. The Dell SupportAssist app installed shows that the warranty expires on 12/23/1018 even though it wasn't purchased until 2/14/2018. Called Dell and they said it was an Amazon issue and to contact them to make the correction. Guess what? Amazon said it was Dell's problem. Called and Chatted (both) with Dell and they said that they would not honor the one year warranty. Reason: the warranty starts when the unit leaves the warehouse since it was on a bulk purchase. REALLY? Contacted the Amazon Seller, Trivalley and they said that they would provide the 1 year warranty. Doesn't sound like a fair deal to me, but grateful for the coverage. Dell has probably lost a future customer even though this is a very nice laptop (see review above). If there were a rating here just for Dell, I would give them a one or two.Additionally, I contacted Dell today regarding the HD being encrypted and unable to partition. Took two chats to resolve this. No help from the first other than a phone number. Called and this tech wanted my life history before helping even though he had my system information.He was a bit irritating and I told him I was going to hang-up and try later. I did a chat again. This chat tech was even willing to do a remote to help out. I didn't have the time for that - so the email route. I got all the information I needed and all is well.",2,2,0,2,2

It does look nice and is build well enough. It charges fast and the battery lasts forever because you'll hardly ever use the thing.The trackpad isn't very smooth to the touch either. I could nit-pick the hell out of this thing, but at the end of the day it's still a dull chromebook.. even with android apps and all that hype, chromeOS just doesn't deliver when compared to similarly priced Windows machines.

I'm an engineering student and I had an okay Dell laptop for a couple of years after my initial Lenovo laptop completely failed on me. The laptop I had was a midrange i5 inspiron that just wasn't fast enough and the start time on it was horrible.I've had this laptop for the last few months and I can run any software I want on it and it's lightning fast. I can run Matlab, compile and run C code, or even do a simulation in Ansys or Solidworks (mainly thanks to the 16GB RAM). If you're borderline between this laptop and maybe like an Acer or Lenovo with similarly impressive hardware stats that's maybe a little cheaper I would absolutely recommend paying a bit more for this laptop. The quality is superb, the specs can't be beat, and the price is extremely reasonable.I haven't tried out any gaming on it yet to check on the graphics card, but with a 4GB Nvidia graphics card, the performance is probably fantastic.The display is great, backlit keyboard is awesome, and for being considered a ""gaming"" laptop it doesn't look to gawdy.I don't care if you're a gamer or not - I'm not - this laptop (with the specs I have) really can't be beat.Okay, now that you found this laptop after searching and wading through reviews and specs for possibly days you can finally stop searching.

Nvidia 1060 graphics card would be better but most laptops that carry one cost closer to $1000. Once you start reaching that high in price Id start looking into gaming PCs because youll get more bang for your buck.The hard drive I received was a Intel SSD 600p. Which is a pcie nvme type ssd hard drive. These are faster then sata based ssd hard drives which are faster then older hdd drives. Laptop starts really fast thanks to hard drive and does virus scans faster too.Battery life is good. It can supposedly go up to 8.5 hours but seems to be more like 6 hours for regular non-gaming tasks with brightness at half and WiFi on. Keep in mind if you try gaming on battery itll only last about an hour or so.Overall I feel like this laptop is very well balanced at this price range that doesnt cut corners on any of the things I value in a laptop. Hard to find a better deal for a gaming laptop that can also double as something to get work done on.,2,0,3,2,2
2252,"Terrible piece of crap laptop. The description said it had an RJ-45 jack and that was the only reason I bought it. Unfortunately the description was a lie. Aside from that, keep in mind it has less drive space than your average microSD card lol.",3,2,5,5,3
2253,"I bought this as a cheap replacement for a previous tablet that I lost. I'll start by saying I use this primarily to watch movies on airplanes and to surf the net, so if you're looking for a review on how this handles intensive gaming, this isn't it.Right out of the box, this thing will need a Windows 10 update. Be prepared to give it AT LEAST 24 hours to go through the entire update. This isn't a fault of the device, but it's slightly annoying if you thought you could just fire this thing up and get started. Do yourself a favor and get started on it as soon as you take it out of the box, plug it in, and connect to the internet. It will save you time down the road when further Windows updates are released.The graphics on this little thing are pretty awesome. I stream Amazon Prime movies and the quality of playback was superb. A big plus for my usage is that it fits perfectly on an airplane seatback tray table and still leaves room for a drink, especially when you detach the keyboard and leave it in your bag (no need for it unless you're typing, but the screen can double for that purpose if you don't have a lot of typing to do). The keyboard itself is very sturdy and doesn't feel cheap at all and provides a nice, protective cover when attached and folded. The keys are very responsive and the integrated trackpad/mouse works as expected. No surprises.I added a Micro SD card with 64 GB to expand the storage and the pics I had we're crystal clear. In fact, the images were better and had more depth and contrast than when I view them on my 23' desktop. The front facing camera is about what you would expect for a device in this price range and the microphone picks up sound pretty well when you're speaking within 4 to 5 feet of the screen. I can Skype with my kids without much issue and I prefer using this for video chatting over using a phone because I can see their faces better on this bigger screen. If you're thinking of using this for business video conferencing, there are probably better quality options for you.The one downside of this (so far) is the sound produced by the device itself. The speaker is pretty awful if you try to listen to it straight from the device and can only be described as ""tinny"" and it is definitely monotone, not stereo. I connected my Bluetooth headphones to this device and the sound was good that way. If you're thinking you can lie around in bed and watch stuff with this, I would recommend headphones otherwise you'll miss out on a lot of background stuff due to the low fidelity of this thing.",2,4,5,6,7

It cause freezing the OS, locking and lagging the mouse. it is very annoying and frustrating when you try to use laptop for work and gaming.1. The keyboard is bad. Very soft and you dont feel the feedback makes its so hard when typing and gaming.2. The weight. Its bit too heavy compare to other similar type of laptop. Makes it hard to carry it around to work.3. The anti glare screen is not too good. And there are some white screen bleeding at the corners.4. Experience some freezes of system when using usb mouse and plug in and out use devices.5.

I replaced the spinning rust with and SSD from my old laptops to save money. Reinstalled Windows and away we go. I have to say I like the touch pad on these more than my Macbook Pro. Normally I hate touch pads but I used it to setup the laptop. The real test if the wife and kids would like them.

2291,"I'd been looking for a half way decent laptop for under $500 that I could use in my hotel room while I travel for work. I ordered a Western Digital 512GB SSD from Newegg the same day I ordered this laptop and upgaded the main hard drive with this and did a clean install of Windows 10 then downloaded and installed the drivers for this unit from the Lenovo website. I'd read reviews mentioning the factory install of Windows wasn't the greatest and had issues so I chose to upgrade main drive and start fresh right off the bat. Since I had no need for an optical drive, I bought a hard drive caddy for the optical bay so the factory 1TB hard drive is now a storage drive. My next upgrade will be to add more RAM but as it is now this is a great laptop so far.After traveling with this laptop for a little over a month it has been a great machine. It's not very heavy and it doesn't take up too much space in my backpack. The build quality seems pretty good and the keyboard is decent. I use it for web browsing, listening to music, and the occasional gaming. So far it runs SWTOR on medium-high. the Bioshock series on high, and Left4Dead2 on high without an issue. I haven't had the chance to try much past that but for what I do play it works perfect, especially when combined with a Logitech M510 wireless mouse.Pros:Good performance, especially after SSD upgradeEasy to upgrade - the bottom of the laptop is a single piece so once that's off everything is accessibleLightweight for its size - It's no Macbook Air but compared to my old Asus UL50 this thing is much lighter and makes it great for travelSpeakers - They won't blow you away but I've heard worseTouchpad - Responsive and solid. The single piece design that manufacturers are going to is hit and miss. Some are terrible, others are great. This one seems to be pretty good so far. It's not so sensitive that the cursor jumps while typing too which is great.Bluetooth - I use my Bluetooth headphones or speaker in my hotel room so the fewer cords on the desk the betterCons:Screen - My biggest gripe is the screen and its limited viewing angle but that seems to be the norm with these units.Internal battery - Not a deal breaker for me but as the unit ages and the battery starts to go, it is built-in so the laptop would have to be disassembled to replace it.Speaker location - I've got mixed feelings about this. They're on the bottom-front of the laptop which keeps the clutter down on the palmrest area, but if the unit is used on the users lap they become muffled. They sound better when the laptop is on a hard surface such as a table or desk which is nice when I'm not using my Bluetooth headphones or speaker on it.",1,4,1,3,2

Also it is very easy to extend like add more RAM or even a M.2 SATA SSD drive.I guess it can run some simple game, I don't play computer game and I never expect Intel graphic chip can do much.The cons is it just have around 4GB RAM available after boot up, maybe its because of the bloatware such as Norton anti virus, I guess remove such softwares or reinstall a clear version Windows could help, also its display drive is not well installed, you have to reinstall it in Device Manager manually.I am happy for this deal.",2,2,1,3,2

2300,"I have owned both a surface pro 3 and asus transformer t300 chi so I have dealt with alot of these 2 in 1 stylus devices before. The Surface pro models are probably the best 2 in 1 computer money can buy. The problem with them, however, is that they cost ALOT of money. When mine broke, i could not justify spending another thousand dollars on a portable computer. I bought an asus transformer chi which offered many of the same features for much cheaper, however the device experience was awful. A sub $500 2 in 1 windows computer is slow, has poor battery life and its 16:9 12"" screen is far too cramped for any real work.That is when I discovered this chromebook. ONLY CHROMEBOOKS can offer a 2 in 1 device with a stylus, 10 hour battery, super high res screen, and premium build quality at this price point. The internals can be cheaper because the OS is so lightweight that expensive processors arent needed to make it run smoothly.HARDWARE: This chromebook delivers on all of those features. The hardware is excellent. It is very thin and very light and you could easily compare this build to the thousand dollar devices such as the Surface and HP Spectre x360. The screen is beautiful. The 3:2 aspect ratio is very convenient and should be a must for any device that converts into a tablet.SCREEN: There is a reason why the Surface devices have a 3:2 screen. The problem with 16:9 convertibles is that they are awkward when in tablet mode. They feel much heavier due to bad weight distribution in that shape, and the screen is terrible for anything in portrait mode because everything is too narrow. 3:2 makes the screen feel much larger than it actually is, and makes it easy to just flip into portrait to read an article with the same dimensions as a real sheet of paper.SOFTWARE: Initially I was hesitant to switch to chrome os due to the familiarity and dependency of Windows software. Get this device if the only thing you are worried about is Microsoft Office. That is the first thing people fear loosing by switching. Not only are there online versions of this software that work perfectly, but google docs is a great alternative that does just about everything most do in Word. (there is also software for power point and excel).The versatility of a 2 in 1 is shines even further with the included play store access. The apps you can get on this device FAR outnumber any windows machine. If you are going to use a 2 in 1 primarily for applications, definitely get this and not a windows machine. The Play Store destroys the windows store in both quantity and quality. Chrome OS operated very smoothly on this device with little hiccups when surfing multiple tabs or running android games and apps. The play store access really allows chromebooks to be used way more offline (which was a previous issue in earlier versions of the OS) Documents can now be typed, notes can be taken, and games could be played with wifi turned off, just like on my Surface.Dont get this if your work requires some weird proprietary software that has no alternatives, and dont get this to edit videos. Thats it. If these do not apply to your use case, this device will work for you. My work requires coding and programming, which surprisingly there is also online alternatives for (cloud9 lets you run online virtual machines).Get this if most of your work is done online. Get this if you love streaming Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, etc... Get this if you like drawing, taking notes, or annotating pdfs. Chrome os will cover about 90% of what most people use computers for. The Webstore combined with the Play store offer alternatives to almost any software on Windows or Mac that you can think of. I am very surprised that this device was able to even be compared to my beloved surface that costs double the price. This is by far the best 2 in 1 360 hinge form factor device that is less than 500 dollars, and its beautiful.",2,4,5,4,5

The main hurdle I have faced lately is using my husband's laptop to use my Cricut for new downloads and projects because my Chromebook would not run it. This worked great for SVG and font files and synced flawlessly with my Cricut. From the moment I opened the box, I was pleased to find a shiny new laptop. It was actually a little bigger than I was expecting at the price point, but I was glad to see the keyboard boasted a number pad which is lacking on many laptops. Once I opened it, plugged it in and turned it on, I was greeted by a Cortana, Microsoft's version of Siri. She walked me through the set up process and I was online within minutes. The TB hard drive is a nice asset for a computer in this price point. The screen was okay but not fabulous.

2327,"*I've added an update to the review at the end*First of all this laptop has great value for price which is tough to match for any other brand on the market. Most people mentioned this but I think it needs to be emphasized. I've had it for about a month and love the look and overall design. The weight is awesome as it's very light yet the aluminum material gives a very classy feel but not as much as the UX390 does with the gold colored details. The technical specs are great but SSD speed could be better, both UX390 and most Dell XPS versions have better speed which is the only area this laptop fails to meet my expectations. 8th generation i7 is running really smooth with no delays so far. The heat is not an issue as it doesn't seem to heat up and I love the speakers as I don't even need any exterior sound system around for a very good experience.It would be better if the same sound experience could be had in non-Windows environments but I'm guessing the drivers should be on the way.Besides the SSD speed the only issue I've witnessed is the scratchy noise like most people mentioned. From my observation it seems to happen when the laptop isn't on a flat surface so some fan looks to be causing the issue.Overall this is a great choice for anyone that doesn't care about the occasional scratchy noise and always on the go. Good connectivity and weight that stands out.UPDATE:I prefer Linux over Windows but stuck with the pre-installed Windows 10. After Ubuntu 18 came out I installed it about 2 weeks ago (May 2018) and haven't noticed the noise since. The original issue might simply be driver related in Windows but too early to tell. I'll be updating this information if I notice the noise again.",3,2,2,0,3
2328,I purchased several of these for our non-profit. The computers are fast and work great for what we are using them for. The SSD is exactly what we were looking for to help with quick startup. This helps our field staff become more productive!,2,2,3,2,2

2340,"so I've had this laptop for a month or two, and at first I was like I'm gonna return this, its laggy and its not worth my time. now that ive spend more than the 2 weeks I planned, to decide if I want to keep it or not. I'm gonna keep it. it has a lot of pros and especially for $200!!pros:-battery life is amazing! and its charges hella fast, about one hour if that for a full charge!!- keyboard- though it would be awesome if it could be backlit but rather than that its pretty good, it is kind of loud of a keyboard.- performance- though It has a lot to be desired, I really only use this for videos and web browsing, a lot of both. after a couple of updates the laggyness has subsided, though there is a glitch here and there.- trackpad! this is an amazing trackpad!! its fluent and very responsive- weight and size- this laptop is amazing when it comes to its size, asus mastered it. I'm forever gonna be an asus fan!! its so light and ugh Its amazing- amazing build quality for $200. it is all plastic but its a $200 computer, what do you expect!- windows 10- I know its cheesy, like duh it comes with windows 10. windows 10 is amazing!! full apps like Netflix, etc on here! and they run damn good!- wifi is amazing! at a campground where my phone doesn't get good wifi reception, this has 3 bars where my phone has 1 to none!cons:- the screen is good when the screen is anything but straight black, you can see a lot of light bleeding through and its more of a gray/whiteish type of black in the corners. but rather than that its pretty good.- the screen does this weird thing where whites are way over saturated which is an easy fix, but in edge and stuff its not ideal to watch videos, but google chrome doesn't have that problem. thank god lol.- occasional laggyness in any browser rather than edge. when scrolling its very choppy and kind of irritating, but if you use edge for browsing and chrome for vids then its ok, no biggy.- I just did a comparison between chrome and edge ( stock windows browser ), I loaded android authority and chrome took longer to come up than edge, and chrome was laggy in scrolling, while edge had a little lag here and there, but for the most part pretty fluid. and I have like 10 tabs open, so quite awesome!- speakers are kind of a hit and miss, If its on your lap sounds good, kind of muffled. and on a harder surface still hit and miss.-storage but there's a sd card slot. it says up to 64gb, but I'm pretty sure it can be up to 128gb.That's really all the cons! the pros out weigh the cons and honestly its a really good laptop for $200!! I did buy an ssdat first I hated this laptop, but after writing this review I'm extremely happy with it!this computer isn't for gaming, though It is a good option for school. but If I were you I'd pay an extra $250-$300 to get the asus zenbook flip ux360ca for twice the ram, way more storage ( ssd) and it keeps a good battery, better display, and even faster performance. and its light and its a 13.3' display and touchscreen! but for $200 you cant beat the price and the performance! hope this helped!",3,1,5,4,3
2341,The size is what I wanted but everything was out dated and won't fully update. I only put 1 app on but the apps that came with it won't update fully. I know that my slow internet is part of the problem but my other lap top updates easily. This was a refurbished laptop,2,2,5,4,6

2343,"TL;DROne of the best laptops out there. Typing on it now, few flaws: one stuck pixel, scratched easily. Arrived to Italy on time, no complaints. Power adapter is 220VAC compatible, just get an US to EU plug adapter.Pros:- ARM CPU (aarch64)- Linux + Google = Love- No Wintel- Full Linux kernel- Ubuntu chroot on dev mode- Developer-ready AND user-friendly at the same time- Awesome screen- Good battery, fast charge- USB 3.0 over USB C- Supports 5GHz Wi-Fi- Expandable storage- Built-in pen- Good build quality- Android apps support increasingly better- InexpensiveCons:- Gets scratched easily- Not the best touchscreen- Max volume is a bit low- Touchscreen could have been betterScore: 87 / 100I might be a bit biased on this but for this price, you get a truly astounding all-rounder. You'll get used to it fast and you'll be able, with a bit of practice, to do serious productivity work on it: it never lets you down. Too bad little flaws here and there lower the score.Review:I live into the Google ecosystem (Android, Drive, Gdocs) and this laptop is a dream: it is swift, you are free from the Wintel ecosystem and the exacore arm (aarch64) provides excellent performance. Dev mode from day one, beta update channel, crouton chroot: this is likely the ultimate development environment. It is basically compatible with any USB device (since it has a fully-fledged Linux kernel) and the userland is quite complete. Android apps support is getting better and better: even strange apps run fine, and emulators such as MAME4droid run smooth. The browser is stable and the computer never crashed on me once. It gets hot, but never too hot to touch it: it is fanless and silent. The touchscreen is good, the pen is good enough for simple drawings: I think I won't be able to live without a Chromebook like this form now on. The charger is excellent: the computer is fully charged in one hour and the battery lasts for at least 5-6 hours of browsing, damn good if you ask me. Connectivity is good. Audio quality is ok but it's too low for listening to music: it's better to use headphones or a portable speaker (it does not like my Darkiron K6 over bluetoot though, nor the Dualshock 4: both cabled work fine). It supports USB 3.0 over USB C and USB multitaps (successfully used up to four devices at once). The screen is retina-like, maybe even better: the OS automatically scales down the resolution as it is too HiDPI to see text at native. Xiwi users will find this an issue: i've stuck to cli only to avoid this. One problem: i have a stuck pixel (from day one, i think). Overall build quality: excellent. The keyboard is not perfect though: the keys are a bit shallow but it's so compact they couldn't have handled it better. Lack of backlighting is not an issue: the screen is so bright that the keys are pretty lit. Mine has a weird ""issue"": one of the two screen brackets is slightly more opaque than the other one. Not sure why though. The price? It's a bargain.No problems getting it to Europe (Italy), everything works fine: fees around 100 euros. Amazon handles everything for you: five stars as always.",2,4,5,4,5
2344,"A great product and entry level laptop.I purchased this laptop for myself as a graduation gift. I was torn between this one and the Acer Predator Helios 300.The reason I went with this laptop over the Acer is not only because of the price (purchased for roughly $400 less than the Acer), but because of its versatility. While this is marketed as a gaming laptop it really doesnt give off that vibe. Sure, it has some of the trademark gamer red accents on it (Dell logo, keyboard + backlighting) and a few smaller discreet accents (heatsinks and the front grill), it doesnt scream gaming like the Acer. It looks like a normal everyday laptop, and Ive received plenty of compliments on it.PROS:The combination of the Intel i5 7567 and NVIDIA GTX 1050 included makes running programs a breeze. Games run well and smooth:Dark Souls III (highest settings): 50-60fpsRocket League (highest settings): 55-60fpsBioshock Remastered (highest settings) 55-60fpsThe 15.6-inch screen is crisp. Its not the brightest, but the model I received is an IPS panel with sharp colors. Its also matte, so if that matters to you, there you go.Only one screw to release the bottom cover.Expandable memory slot (M.2 NVME SSD), and expandable RAM.The speakers are loud and clear.The battery is good. Should last at least 2-3 hours with medium gaming, but only about an hour or so doing some heavy gaming (Dark Souls, etc).CONS:The fans can get a bit noisy under load.While the laptop generally runs pretty cool, there are some hotspots on the keyboard (specifically near the WASD keys). It wont melt your fingertips off, but it can get uncomfortable.The included 1TB 5400rpm hard drive is a bit sluggish. Luckily, this laptop includes an M.2 NVME SSD slot, which can be used to clone windows onto. I purchased a 275GB M.2 NVME SSD, cloned windows onto it, and now it boots up in less than 10 seconds. This can be a bit tricky, but I highly recommend it.There are 3 USB ports, and all of them are 2.0. A shame, but not a deal breaker.Overall, this laptop is great for some entry level gaming and productivity. One big reason I knocked a star off is because the battery/internals cover on the bottom of the laptop broke (the little tabs around the edges snapped off while reattaching it). Not a big issue, as Dell sent me a replacement, but charged me $21.99 for a used one.",1,0,1,2,2

2346,"I have had this laptop for a few days now and I love it! It is very fast. The only thing that I wish it had (and I knew this before purchasing) is a numeric keypad, so I have to use the number buttons on the top. The fingerprint scanner is also a very nice feature.",2,2,1,2,2
2347,"Works well as a chromebook.Pen:The pen seems forced and is more for novelty than true samsung pen usage. It's only good for drawing on the drawing app. The google handwriting recognition is a bit odd to use but works well.Google apps:I use this primarily as a chromebook but with a 12.5 inch screen, it's great for reading marvel unlimited comics after you download the marvel unlimited app from the app store. I've found that most android apps have better web versions so I've only ended up using marvel unlimited and teamviewer as the apps I use primarily with this. Other apps like google music would be great to use as apps since you can control it from the notification area instead of having to switch to the tab.Media:It plays netflix (website) and plex (website) videos very well. I haven't really tried the apps for both of them on this device. I was able to use this device with a usb-c to hdmi connector and watched a couple of shows on an external monitor. It was clear and had no stuttering problems that I typically get from my asus rockchip chromebook. I was on a couple of social media websites, an image site and a chat site while this was going on so that I could watch while I did other things too.What I don't like.So far, being nitpicky, the pen doesn't do anything. I haven't been able to try and install the galaxy note apps on it so that i can try that and the google play store on chrome OS does not support some games.",2,4,5,4,5

2358,"I've had a lot of computers, and this might be my favorite. The screen is flawless - bright and high-resolution. The stylus is a little cramped, but very responsive and pressure sensitivity is dead-on (I'm typically using Infinite Painter for drawing, which works great). A little too heavy for use as a true tablet or e-reader, but it's easy to put in ""easel mode"" on my lap to do drawing or play some games. Performance is so-so - definitely keeps up with multiple browser tabs and fairly intensive Android apps, but it's just a little pokey all the time. For a couple hundred dollars more, you can get the Pro version, which ought to be a lot peppier. But I got this as a second computer, and I don't need high performance. Also, if you're dubious about Chromebooks, I can only say that I have run into very few situations where it can't do what I want, thanks to having full access to both the Chrome and Android app stores.Does this have flaws? Absolutely.

I'll be moving the OS and some games to a M.2 SSD soon.Pros:-Great design, feel and sturdiness-Fast to boot-Strong graphics card-Long lasting battery-Fantastic priceCons:-Pretty weak speakers, but I only use headphones anyway-Screen quality is somewhat low but you really don't notice itThe pros vastly outweigh the cons so I definitely recommend it.",1,0,1,2,2

2402,"Love this laptop!!! I use it as a trading station and for any gaming with my kids. It's nicely priced, and truly is a beast with an overall small weight. Only critique is it does show hand/fingerprints so you do need to clean it occasionally or it looks like a giant smudge.",2,0,1,2,2
2403,"First, before you complain about the size of the hard drive, you must understand that this is meant to be an online computer. Meaning that you use online apps instead of downloading and installing apps. That being said, you will need an extra flash drive to install windows updates. Also, obviously not all apps have online versions. I would not recommend this laptop to any coders because you cannot install visual studio on this computer, the program is just too big. Other than that it's a nice cheap version that would be great for students for taking notes, writing papers, or anything that can be done strictly online.",3,4,5,4,3

2405,"The best first gaming laptop , the only downside is the body is made of a ""fingerprint magnet"" plastic and it might feel a bit cheap but for the price and the specs is really good.",2,0,1,2,2
2406,Bought this for my wife. She loves it. Now she's got the best computer in the house. Fabulous picture and very fast. Only drawback is that Windows needs to work a little on their tablet mode interface.,3,3,3,2,4
