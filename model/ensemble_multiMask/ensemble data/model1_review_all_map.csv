2,"I just got the laptop today and have finally customized and installed everything I need on it (aside from all the games I want). I am a Computer Science major and avid PC game player so this laptop will be perfect for me. The laptop I had before this one was another ASUS ROG, I believe it was the GL551JM. It had Intel i7, GeForce GTX 960m, 1TB HDD, and 256GB SSD. So really the only upgrade I went for with a new laptop was the new processor, graphics card, and overall design. So far I love this design of the laptop, it feels very sturdy and comfortable and honestly it is quite sexy and slim. I was so happy when I took it out of the box. Another reason I upgraded laptops was because I had my previous one for about 3 years and the motherboard was giving out, the display wouldn't always turn on so I had to power on and off the laptop until it did. Occasionally the screen would have a glitch of pink lines coming up from the bottom of the screen. So it was in due time of getting a new laptop. I do hope this one will last longer than my last one, I will be sure to take extra care of this one too. It doesn't help that I commute back and forth from school with the laptop but this new one is slimmer and lighter than the last.",2,0,1,0,2
3,It kept giving the message no storage. Came with installed games from previous owner.,3,4,5,4,3
4,In the middle of trying to resolve an issue with the laptop frequently losing WiFi internet connection whereas our other devices stay connected. Hopeful that we dont have a lemon. Love the slim lightweight design.,3,3,3,2,4
5,The best purchase in terms of computers. Sometimes it is a little noisy but the battery life and the light weight combined with it's practicality make it a wonderful choice.,3,3,3,2,4

7,"This is the worst laptop I have ever owned. It's slow. The touchpad is unresponsive intermittently. It locks up while doing something in the back ground that you can hear the drive moving, but gives no indication what the hell it is doing. I've tried everything I can to speed this thing up. I about to throw it out and try something else. I would have sent it back, but I ended up having to have surgery and the return time ran out.",2,2,1,2,2

10,"Let me start by saying Ive been an Apple-only user until recently. I use my MacBook Pro for work and my iPad when Im traveling. Ive been traveling more and more as of late, and I find that the iPad really cant do everything I need. For the amount of time I spend on an airplane, I need a fully functional device capable of heavier lifting than the iPad. But for the amount of time I spend trekking through airports, I need a device that I can carry easily in my shoulder bag. The MacBook Pro starts to feel heavy when Im on the long march between concourses. So Ive been looking for a new computer that can replace both the iPad and the Mac, and I think Microsoft might have just created it.The Surface Laptop is very sleek. The fact that you can open it with one finger is super helpful for me as Im often on the phone while on my computer, and now I can use one hand for each. I also like that theyve made it with fabric rather than just all metal. Much nicer especially when it gets cold outside; no more cold fingers from the cold metal of my computer.What I like most though is that Microsoft has optimized this device for security. The Windows 10 S operating system is such a smart idea. How great to be able to go anywherein style!and not have to worry about my computer being safe from viruses.I have to say, Im becoming a convert. I never thought Id leave Apple but Im so impressed with what Microsoft is doing. First the Surface Studio and now the Surface LaptopI guess were going to be a Windows household soon!",1,2,3,2,4
11,VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.,2,2,1,3,2
12,"I love it, so far! Quite easy to convert to Office 10 Pro if you already have it on another machine. Thanks Microsoft! Thanks to a quick internet search, I didn't even have to call my brother-in-law to help!",0,2,3,2,4

14,"didn't realize that it doesn't have windows 10, strictly made for chrome, I'm",2,2,5,4,2
15,"I don't see why this computer is getting so many good reviews. In fact, I am suspicious. I bought it to replace my 4-year-old ThinkPad X230. I barely noticed a difference. I am not a gamer but I do use programs like Sketchup which my slows down my current machine a lot. I thought a gaming laptop would be good for that. This thing just sucked all around. I had it for about 2 weeks and it was starting to crash when using Chrome,at least once per day. To top it all off, I attended an all day seminar this week and planned to be on my laptop all day. You would think a brand new laptop would have 8 hours of battery power. (It was fully charged, I keep it plugged in at home). IT DIED AFTER 3 HOURS AND 20 MINUTES. I know because I arrived at 7:45am and looked at the time it died, and it was 11:06. All I was doing on it was using MS Word and surfing the net. Not watching video. This was the last straw and it is now on its way back to the seller. (Not Amazon; I am putting the review here rather than on the seller's site because I do not want to p*ss them off while the return is in progress. But I wanted to tell others how much this purchase sucked and how very disappointed I am in this product.)",1,0,1,2,2
16,"I have one model earlier than this laptop, and it has been almost exactly 1 year since I bought it. I bought this laptop because I needed something cheap that I could use for 3D work on the go, take into meetings, etc.This is a really fantastic laptop if you want a good price for great performance. In its unused time, I have been running it 24/7 constantly calculating BOINC calculations for the SETI massive parallel computation project. This is a killer calculation that is very hard on computers, maxing out both the CPU and the GPU simultaneously. My Macbook air overheated and totally died after just a few months running like this. Two of my desktops also choked on it. This laptop, though, gets really hot, but just keeps on going!Performance wise, it has been great for just about every game I have played on it. It's pretty close to desktop level performance. I also was running the Oculus Rift with it (on a GTX 1060 card) without issue, so the newer model with even upgraded specifications should be great for such tasks.Reliability wise, it's just kept on going. It has be very dependable.It's a larger laptop, so maybe not for everyone. It gets hot in use, and it is really hungry for power with a quite short battery life. It's enough to get through a meeting, but if I'm the presenter I will always bring my power brick.I cannot speak for their tech support / service, as I never had the need, which I guess is good.We bought several others for folks at my work, and they have all been running great as well, as far as I know.Bottom line: This is a great ""lots of power for the money"" laptop that has been super reliable for me, and I would recommend it to anyone with similar needs to me, but not if all you need a super lightweight long battery life unit for just email and facebook.",2,0,1,2,2

18,As a gaming pc this thing is garbage. Its contently freezing. The sound is awful. But on the bright side it likes to stay up to date no matter what you are doing....if the updates work,1,0,1,2,2
19,"I had one of these and was underwhelmed (finally sent it back). It's not fast, it's not as light as it should be, and it would freeze and stutter and was just basically disappointing overall. For $1300 you get the Intel core i5 (NOT the i7) and only 8G of RAM, which is not nearly enough to run Win 10 well at all. My advice? By something else- for $1300 you can get one speed demon of a laptop that will blow this thing out of the water. This is just my opinion, your mileage may vary.",1,2,3,2,4
20,DONt know why but the sound keeps messing up. Other wise good product shipping was on point!,2,2,1,4,2
21,"This is a punchy little laptop for its price that pleasantly surprised me in a lot of ways, and disappointed me in others. Part of my amazement with some of it probably has to do with the fact that my everyday workhorse laptop is a couple of years old, now. It certainly feels outdated next to this thing! I'll start with the good.* The laptop is REALLY light. When the box came, my husband didn't believe there could really be a laptop inside. He thought I was joking when I told him that's what it was. Weight doesn't honestly matter to me that much because I don't tote my laptop around, but if weight's an issue for you -- I really can't imagine laptops getting much lighter than this.* It turns on fast. Really fast. It has the OS on a solid state drive, and then a terabyte drive for storage, and the advantage to this is that solid state drives boot up super fast. This is a laptop that I'd have less of a problem with shutting down regularly, because turning it back on again takes about the same amount of time as it takes my laptop to come out of sleep mode. It's that fast.* It packs a fair amount of power without the heat. I've tested it on both Overwatch and Minecraft, and while it won't do either of those games at their best graphics settings (or even near-best), it does run them, and runs them smoothly. Moreover, it does so without producing a lot of heat, which surprised me. I have ordered a fancy chill pad to go with this laptop, since I anticipate it's going to be doing a lot of playing games with high graphics requirements, but I'm not seeing a lot of heat issues, even without it.* I thought the whole 'thin bezel' thing was silly until I saw this laptop's screen. It really does make my old laptop's screen seem outdated and clunky.* The speakers are decent, for what they are. They don't have much of a bass, but they did bring out some things in the other registers of the music I was listening to that impressed me. If you just want 'thump, thump, thump', they're not the speakers for you, But they might hold up okay, for music that has a little more than that going on.* Battery life was pretty decent. My roommate played Overwatch for hours on it and didn't realize that it wasn't plugged in.Now the bad:* This is the biggest concern I have with this laptop: The charger gets REALLY hot, and the wire itself seems flimsy. Between the hot charger and the flimsy wire, I'm expecting that my charger isn't going to last long. This isn't something I'm terribly comfortable leaving plugged in and walking away, either.* It comes with a lot of bloatware which you then have to go through and uninstall, which is kindof a pain. I don't get why companies do this. Also, it tries to push McAfee on you. I don't know why companies do this, either.* The speakers, while decent, could be better. But I've been saying that about my laptops for years, and have yet to own one where they ARE better. Still, when my iPhone has better sound, it feels like there's room for improvement.* Given how light and thin it is, I'd actually be a little afraid to tote this thing around too much without some kind of really protective case. It seems like it could get damaged too easily.",1,2,1,2,3
22,"This is perfect for homework for my middle schooler. Also, I use it to draw using the Adobe sketch program. Much cheaper than an ipad pro!!",2,4,5,4,5

29,"This is the worst misrepresentation by the seller. Both Samsung products were refurbished and that is why it was presented at a lower price for $139.99. Both products have lots of scratches on top monitor. One of them on the left corner of the keyboard is bent and cracked. I was planning to give them as Christmas gifts to my daughters, now I have to return them and get another set. Really disappointment.",3,3,5,5,6
30,"I just got my laptop today. This review is for the Asus 11.6 inch 4 RAM Quad-Core.I absolutely love the size and sleekness of the laptop! For the price, it runs amazingly. It's not the fastest computer I've ever worked on but there is no slowness or delay either. Being that this purchase also comes with a year of Microsoft Office included (Microsoft Word, Excel, etc) you can't beat the price. Purchase of that alone is over $100.The color is less gold than it appears in the photo, it's more of a champagne which I was even more pleased with.I work every day on a normal size desktop keyboard at work and this keyboard feels comfortable to me.Also, I tested streaming Netflix and there was no lag and the display looked great!Very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a small laptop for travel and a laptop for basic browsing, emails and spreadsheet and document use!",3,1,5,4,3
31,"A workhorse laptop with a large, HD screen, 16GB memory, quad cores, backlit keyboard, and large hard drive makes for a solid gaming or development platform  even better, this ASUS ROG STRIX Thin and Light Gaming Laptop is also (relatively) lightweight! Lets take a closer look.Here are the basic specs, and be sure to also see the included pics:* 16GB RAM* 15.6 full HD screen (1920 x 1080 pixels)* Storage: 256GB SATA SSD and 1TB HDD drives* Dimensions:15.1 x 10.3 x 0.9 inches, and weighing in around 5.6 pounds* CPU: 7th-generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core 2.8GHz (Turbo to 3.8GHz) with discrete GeForce GTX 1050 4GB graphics* I/O: Bluetooth 4.1, 3x USB 3.0, 1x USB 3.1 (Type C), 1x USB 2.0, 1x HDMI, 1x Mini DisplayPort, 1x headphone/Mic jack, and 1x RJ45 LAN port, and 802.11ac 22 WiFi* Keyboard: Aura RGB lighting keyboard with 4 isolated hotkeys, 1.6mm key travel, and anti-ghosting technology. 4 zones of lighting control. 20-million keystroke durability.* DVD: As the current trend, there is no DVD drive. Im now accustomed to that, so dont miss it. You can connect USB to an external DVD (eg Apple DVD drive worked) if you must.The laptop comes with Windows 10 Home as the OS. Both MS Office and MS OneDrive came pre-installed but unactivated. I used Control Panel | Programs and Features to uninstall both products, as this is targeted to be a development machine. I installed Oracles VirtualBox to run virtual machines. With quad cores, this is a good host for VMs.There is a numeric keypad, which would be good for accounting and tax chores. I loved the backlit keyboard and the ability to change the backlit colors with the pre-installed ASUS app. The touch pad did not have individual buttons, but was more of a universal pad where when you click on the left it is a one-click and if you click on the right it is a double-click. It took me about thirty minutes to get used to it, but now I like it.Since there are two WIFI adapters, you can connect to WIFI, and also share that WIFI with other devices, creating a hotspot. No cellular though  wouldnt that have been a dream?Regarding the 1.25TB of space: The space is 256GB of SSD on which the OS is installed, and 1TB of HDD space that is available for end-user storage. The 1TB drive is end-user replaceable.The display is a very crisp 15.6 full HD screen (1920 x 1080 pixels). This is *not* a touch screen, although I keep trying.The logo that appears on the back of the metal (aluminum?) lid lights up. Although the lid is nice, the base of the unit is plastic.The lithium ion battery life is OK  generally I got less than five hours of varied use including installing software. This workstations does have quad cores after all, and youll definitely hear the fan when it kicks on. The power brick is huge (not great for travel), but it does tend to charge the laptop quickly (within two hours).All in all this is a fast Windows laptop that could serve as a solid gaming or development platform, and Im happy with it.I hope you found this review helpful!",2,0,1,0,2
32,Not a good experience soon as the cable left i couldn't get online and closing the page was impossible,3,1,5,4,3
33,Only $200 and you can add a $25 160 gb internal hdd.Upgrading to a better windows os makes it better. The laptop is loud when there is no noise around you but if you're a crowded environment you won't hear it.,3,1,5,4,3
34,"It's just ok. Battery is not that great and I am having extremely irritating issues with wi-fi. It continuously loses internet connection. The internet issue started about a month ago, a few months after I purchased this. It has trouble just finding a wi-fi to connect to and when it does it loses it. I have restarted in and shut it down, waited a while, and started back up and still internet issues. When you pay over $800 for a laptop you would expect it to work perfectly for at least a year especially since I don't do much on it",2,2,1,2,2

43,Guys this computer died on me 3 months after I bought it and is no longer eligible to be returned or have free product support. For real????? I guess I'll take it in to a Microsoft store and see if they can do any better for me. A HUGE DRAG.,1,2,3,2,4
44,"I had been looking for an affordable laptop with the features this laptop has. There were no reviews at the time, but I was pleased with the specs and ordered it. This is a decent laptop for the money. This is not a very powerful laptop, but for my basic needs it will work well. I have found when using the laptop when it's charging, it gets hot around the upper left area of the keyboard. There are a lot of programs on here that you will probably want to remove as there is about 10 GB of free space remaining when it arrives. The laptop is light being under 4 lbs and nice and thin to take on the go. Overall a decent value and buy for the money.",3,4,5,4,3
45,great little computer I am using it right now I had the 2gb ram dual core and gave it to my mom and upgraded to this 4gb quad core get the 4gb it seems faster I paid $199 so I'm very happy,3,1,5,4,3
46,"I really wanted to love this computer. I always do a lot of research before I buy things and the biggest complaint on this computer was that it was slow. I can live with slow. I just wanted something that I could take to work with me to access documents and literature. This computer was so slow I couldn't even access the internet. You'll need to buy a micro SD card for extra storage if you want to update Windows. That wasn't a big deal for me. Any of these cheap computers with 32gb storage can barely handle windows. The build quality seemed pretty good for the price. The only thing I couldn't deal with was how slow it was. I had to send this one back and get something with a faster processor. The all day battery life was nice with the ATOM processor but it just couldn't handle Windows 10. I ended up getting a little blue Dell Inspiron for about $50 and it has a celeron processor, which is a little faster but sacrifices battery life. It also has a touch screen and folds all the way around like a tablet. It's so much faster and feels like a better laptop, although it has a few drawbacks also. The ASUS had a better touch pad and I liked the location of the power button compared to the Dell. Oh, and the speakers are horrible on the ASUS. The Dell is very loud, like unbelievably loud for a laptop with this price. Overall, the ASUS is well built but it's too slow for even the most basic tasks, such as checking email, and the speakers are very bad. Get the touchscreen Dell for $250.",3,1,5,4,3
47,"I have had this for two weeks now. This is my fourth Chromebook and 2nd touch screen. So far, this is my favorite. I loved the size of the Acer C100 touch screen but this is almost as light. The screen is wonderful.

My husband bought one too and he has no complaints either.",2,4,5,4,5
48,"Arrived early and as expected from EXcaliberPC. They did awesome. But, after 2 weeks the HDD failed. I meticulously took care of this, it was only used on a desk and kept in the box when not in use. I am in the process of getting the RMA done. Apparently I have to pay for shipping one way and it will leave me without a computer for 30+ days. That is a BUMMER. I did not abuse this thing, it was a defective item. Yet I have to pay for shipping and wait for them to OPEN it up, poke around and hopefully fix it. I would rather just get a new one since this had problems right out of the gate. I have always heard good things about MSI. I guess I will see how this works out for me because I feel pretty let down and may try other brands next time.",1,0,1,2,1

51,"This is by far the slowest computer I've ever owned. Ive had base model Lenovo, Gateway and those performed much smoother. I bought this because I thought it was a good decent affordable Laptop. It is cheap compared to others , and it looks good, neither of those factors improves its slow, slow performance. When you first start it up the laptop is overrun by BS Microsoft apps and programs they want you to use. Blatant advertising, (perhaps thats why it is so affordable). Between all the notifications from other un needed products and trying to install programs you actually use, (itunes, opera web browser for me) this computer goes oh so slow. Not worth the purchase I would say, keep looking for a better computer. It could be worth spending a bit more for a better device. And if you have an external hard drive get ready for a major performance decrease with this computer. Huge bummer",2,4,5,4,3

55,"It is a great laptop and for the money its simply awesome. I bought it for school work and some occasional gaming (I know it's more of a gaming laptop but I prefer more graphics than no graphics ;) ). I personally am not a huge gamer, so I allowed my brother to check for fps and stuff. He was getting 60-65 fps on Rainbow Six Siege on medium setting all around and about 30 fps on extremely high settings. I have been using the laptop for a couple of hours now and it feels great and runs smooth. I will update my ratings if something goes wrong (hoping it won't).There is however one big flaw: The track pad feels just awful. Thankfully I had ordered a mouse beforehand so its not a issue for me.Edit: after an entire semester of coding classes, I am extremely happy with the performance. For gaming part, it gets hot after about half an hour of heavy gaming but works fine with lower end gaming and school work.",2,0,3,2,2

It is easy and quick to type on with good key feel and travel. If I could change one thing it would be the screen flex. This version has a metal top but when I first opened it I could tell that the cover was so lightweight that it would bend very easily, which it does. On the other hand, I believe that this is the best laptop overall that you can buy at the low end of $1000. The 8th gen i7 is very fast and I expect to be happily using this laptop for several years. Also, the slim bezels which allow for the 14-inch screen in this form factor are important. Don't go out and get a 13-inch screen on another laptop. That extra inch makes a difference.",3,2,2,0,3

I purchased this one because I needed a personal computer, BUT it is so incredibly slow it's almost impossible to use. It takes forever to load start screen then once that's open im lucky if i can get the browser up. I'm very disappointed since he has more features than my other Lenovo that is 2 years old and has alot of docs and programs stored on it. I have nothing stored on the new one and im ready to throw it out the window. I cant even imagine trying to play a game on it as advertised!

67,"The purchase of a Surface laptop has been the most negative customer experience of my life. And I've dealt with banks and insurance companies.I bought the Laptop in early August and was happy at first, as it seemed like a good alternative to the MacBook / Pro. After about 45 days of light to no use, the laptop failed completely and tech support was unable to resolve, so refund / replacement was the only option.I thought about it and based on the news that had recently come out re Consumer Reports and the very high failure rate, I opted for refund, as my spidey sense told me this product had been rushed to market. I asked for a refund; as I was at 45 days vice 30, the request would have to be referred up for approval, response in 24-36 hours. Fine. A week goes by, nothing heard - I call, they advise 'your request has been denied.' Fine, I'll go with replacement, sell it on Kijiji, buy a MacBook. They send me ... a refurb. A highish end laptop fails after 45 days and MS believes a refurb is a fair trade. Now I'll have difficulty selling the laptop. I call back and say no way, not acceptable. They say 'just go in person into the store, they'll give you a brand new one.' The nearest store is 4 hours by car, can't do, have to do it via courier. They say 'We can't send a new laptop via courier, if you're genuinely not happy, ask for a refund'. I advise already tried, no success. They said, no, I'm looking at your file, a refund was never requested. So I waited for a week just to find out that first agent lied outright to me.Bottom line - I'm more than 2 weeks without a laptop, have spent in excess of 7 hours on the phone they consistently refuse to refer me to head office or any other level of customer support that might be able to authorize replacement with a new computer via courier. Apparently only Bill Gates himself could authorize such a thing, and he's busy. They have have ignored queries sent over email, Facebook and Twitter. This is what you can expect when your Surface fails.My sincere recommendation is buy a MacBook; the reliability is one thing, but the arrogance and ineffectiveness of MS customer service team is what makes me certain I WILL NEVER BUY A PIECE OF MS HARDWARE FOR ME OR MY FAMILY AGAIN. I've never had a major failure of an Apple desktop or laptop, when I've had issues with peripheral devices they have replaced even out of warranty.The product is not ready for market, the company is not willing to work with the poor suckers who got on early to try to find a good outcome. I will be buying a MacBook as soon as this circus is resolved.",1,2,3,2,4

70,"I've had the laptop for two months and haven't had a single issue. It runs clean and is very responsive. I had to upgrade the RAM because I do virtualization and some machine learning stuff, but the fact that all I had to do is supply more RAM is a testament to the quality of the laptop. Also, after installing the new RAM the boot time went down noticeably. Power-on to login screen takes about 5 seconds.For those interested, this is the RAM I bought:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BIWKP58/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",1,0,1,2,2

72,"I have had some problems with my device among which are the heat produced which is much higher than I expected because in some reviews mentioned that I had a good thermal solution, the problem is that by playing about two hours the device gives a few pulls and you can not continue with the games session, another issue is that my device brings two 4GB RAM memories and usually usually comes with only one of 8GB leaving a slot free and then add another if necessary but in my case I must buy two if I need 16gb of ram, the network card on the other hand is quite slower than I expected since I have the same card in another device and it gives me quite good speed however with this barely and it helps me web browsing, I tried to reinstall the drivers that previously had updated but has not had any effect, otherwise everything is fine and I guess the defects that have i machine does not have to occur in other devices of the same series however it is a point to take into account since they can not launch equipment with these defects without a previous revision of them.",1,0,5,2,2

I will be replacing the hard drive with an SSD drive, but between the drive and purchasing a copy of windows 10, that is going to add another $300 on top of the price of the laptop just to get it to run without freezing.",3,2,1,2,2
74,"For the price, it's a good deal.Pros:- Keyboard is large, quiet, easy to type on.- Big 1080P screen is nice. But not perfect, see cons.- System is responsive, and doesn't lug down or lag during web browsing, office use.- Minimal bloatware.- SSD seems speedy enough. It's a bit on the small side. After deleting most unneeded apps (including Office), installing others (Chrome, Evernote, VPN), and doing the raft of system updates needed, it has just over 10 GB free. Which is enough for streaming movies and connecting to the office via RDC for the heavy lifting, but skimpy if you want to run Office locally...or pretty much any other big suite like Adobe.- Lots of ports.- Good battery life.Cons:- Trackpad is touchy sometimes, unresponsive others. Turning off multi-finger gestures seems to help.- Trackpad is noisy. It clicks pretty loudly when you press on it.- Vertical viewing angle is pretty narrow. Tilt the screen a little bit and the colors darken or wash out. Not a big deal when surfing the web or doing office stuff, but distracting when watching movies.- Windows 10 Home. Lots of stuff you can't disable or remove. But it gets the job done.- Weight is of course a little more than a typical modern 11"" or 13"" laptop.- SD card sticks out a ways.Overall, it's a nice system. The trackpad is probably the biggest issue. But a $10 Bluetooth mouse is a good workaround.",3,4,5,4,3

The only problem I have had so far is I closed the computer and the screen would not come on so I had to turn it off and back on but after that it was fine. I really love how lightweight the computer is and the size is just perfect. My previous computer was a 2010/11 model MacBook Pro and I find that the dimensions and appearance are very similar, just now sleeker and thinner. I didn't think I would use the tablet function much on this computer but after testing it out today I may have to play around with it more. I saw several negative reviews about this machine and I don't see why, other than perhaps those people just got a bad egg. I would most definitely recommend this computer to students and anyone who needs a lightweight computer on the go or something easy for personal use. Maybe not for someone who needs their computer to do tons of heavy lifting, as it is not meant for that.

My Huawei Matebook X touchpad responds when I decide to use it which is every time I'm using the computer. Changing the sensitivity doesn't help.

It is lighter and slimmer than previous laptops Ive had and has an attractive brushed metal finish that really appeals to me.My only complaint is that the Delete key is right next to the Power button. This, according to Murphys Law means that the likelihood that you will accidentally shut the computer off will increase in direct proportion to the importance of the document you are working on.

Eventually I turned on windows narrator and realized that even though the screen was black, the install process was in fact still continuing. I used tab to navigate the invisible options and listened to the narrator until I managed to finish the initial windows installation blind.

120,"I'm writing this review since the reviews I have read in the past did not cover what I wanted to know about this laptop. Ill be comparing this to an older laptop that I got from frys rocking a 960m and a 6th gen i5.BuildOld laptop was also a 15.6 inch IPS display but the RGB percentage was much higher to being the same quality i have on my desktop, This dell has an ips display but I think its somewhere around 50% rgb so colors do look washed out but not as bad as a TN panel.Despite being a 15 inch laptop it is not wider but about an inch longer than my old laptop, some users described problems using sleeves with this. It is also heavier so it is a little cumbersome to carry around.The trackpad on this is very very good, I enjoy it and can actually do productivity work without the need of a mouse which is great, the touchpad on my older laptop was garbage. The keyboard on this is passible, keys feel thin and flimsy and I cant type as fast as id like to and I have issues gaming on it on first person shooters whenever I need to crouch jump and move forward (ctrl+w+space)SpecsIt has a 7300hq which seems to be able to handle whatever I want to throw at it and got me a browser spedometer test of 130.1060 with max q. It has the ability to max out any game i have tried on it so far with good framerates but if I do the fans kick on really loud and depending on the game the section above the f10-f11 keys can get really hot to touch.If you play off battery it will limit itself to 30fps on any game and run reasonable cool and quiet.Games Ive tested were really demanding games like Nier Automata and Rust. both at 1080 and no issues at 60fps+Battery:My old laptop would get 2-3 hours of non gaming use off battery and 30 mins If i launched any game, be it older games from the xbox360 era like ff13 or modern games. Basically cant use it unplugged.Dell on the other hand. was able to run 8-10 hours of non gaming use depending on brightness (40%-60%) (100% brightness got me about 6 hours) which is really good for a gaming laptop. Also another thing to note is that if you are just browsing youtube or typing up stuff the fans wont kick in and the laptop will be passively cooled so there will be no noise to bother others if you are in a library setting.Gaming off battery would get me a little less than 3 hours for older games like FF13. and 90 minutes for more demanding modern games like nier and rust so its possible to have a quick gaming session on the go when there is no plug to be found.Bottom lineIf you want to buy this laptop I recommend you buy it from costco because it is currently $750 right now, add in 8 gigs of ram and add in a 1TB drive (should cost you about an extra 100 for both) and now you are looking at a fully loaded laptop for $850.If you are going to game on this plugged I also recommend to download the geforce experience drivers and set whisper mode so that your laptop wont try to kill itself giving you 100+ fps at the expense of getting scalding hot and sounding like a jet engine taking off. Whisper mode reduces the work the gpu will do and give you a locked 60 fps on shooters and 40fps on other games but your laptop will run cooler and quieter.",1,0,5,2,2

129,I LOVE IT! As soon as I got it i noticed that the color was not as shiny as I thought it would be but it is still a rose gold color. Really light weight and the keyboard is perfect. Reminds me of a mac design which is perfect. Considering I haven't had it for two weeks it has done a lot of upgrading. Which makes sense because it's new but all it does is update and after all the updates were installed it said my storage was almost full which I did not like.

130,"There are many reviews out there that will tell you most of the intricacies of owning this computer, but there is a thing or two I did not see mentioned before so I would like to put it out for those few people who may find them important.To start politely, if you are looking for a laptop computer, you should seriously consider this one. It has all the potential you may want. It is just that it has limitations, too.First trivia about it is that the power button is located on the keyboard. It is between other buttons, not bigger and not smaller, just one of the buttons there. It is not even the one in the corner, it is the second one from the right in the top row. You will get used to it, but the choice of the position is unexpected, at least.Much more important to me is the fact that computer is practically barely usable unless you open the Microsoft Store account. It does not work straight from the box in the way computers should. Well, it will work with what comes preinstalled on it, but nothing else. A lot has been written about pros and deficiencies of Windows 10 S so I will skip those details, but you are not going to install anything on them without Microsoft Store account. Every review on every tech site will tell you that it qualifies for FREE upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and then you will be able to install programs the way you are used to with no limitations. Unfortunately, no website mentioned that Windows 10 Pro cannot be installed/upgraded to without Microsoft Store account. In case you thought that paying serious money to get a computer with operating system should be enough, you are out of your nave luck. You will be able to meaningfully use that same computer only if you join the Microsoft Store club from which you may not have any intention to ever buy anything. Where is the rationale for asking gender and date of birth to open an account for upgrading to the operating system you were promised you would be able to easily upgrade to after you paid for the computer is open to discussion.Aside of that Apple-esque idea, I think the computer may be good for those who have Microsoft Store accounts and do not feel fooled by not being able to upgrade without joining the club. For the rest of us, it is a machine that could, but failed to deliver due to pre-installed software limitations.Please note, reviews of the new computer are not of the feel of the buttons or softness of the Alcantra only. They involve preintalled software and ability to use the item without having to jump through the unadvertised hoops.",0,2,3,2,4

It's listed at 8 hours, but of course depending on how you use it that will vary. Having USB Type-C is a nice touch, as well as USB 3.0 ports. Of course for me, the 8GB of RAM it comes with is enough, but it's a little ""future proofed"" with the ability to add more, which is always a plus. My only gripe is that it doesn't have a dedicated graphics card, but it can still handle some less demanding games.I'd definitely recommend this to anyone trying to upgrade from an older laptop, or just someone who wants a good all around laptop in general",1,4,1,2,2
140,"I was looking for a gaming laptop under 1,000$ with powerful GPU, there were lot of options out there, but everyone has its own cons which held me from buying it, the options I have been Lenovo Y520, Asus 553, Dell 7567, Acer Predator Helios 300 and MSI GL62MY520 had a horrible keyboard and numpad even though its screen was great, Dell was heavy as a piano, Helios was an amazing option especially on the black Friday, it dropped from 1,050$ to 900$ yet I passed it. and then came to the GL62M and purchased with a great offer of 800$ from Amazon (but from my brother's account) that's why I'm not seen as a verified purchase.Anyway, coming to the pros and cons, What I like about the GL62M:- Lightweight comparing to others from the same category- The keyboard is noiseless- The laptop runs cool and quiet, except while gaming It would become a chopper but that's fine with me- Powerful GPU 1050TI, CPU I7-7700 which makes gaming experience so amazing, played COD WW2 and Shadow of war both on High details FHD- It came with 1TB HDD, and Samsung 128GB SSD reaching 2700MB/s reading speed and 520 Writing speed- Came with English version of windows not as many people complained about getting a Chinese version, boots up in 13 secsWhat I didn't like about it:- The windows key is on the right side of the space which is weird and sometimes frustrating during my office work (Win+D) along with Del, home and end keys being in an abnormal place, other than that its good keyboard- Screen: the TN screen is not quite the deal for gaming, its fine with office work and browsing, but when it comes to gaming, it will be a bit of a disappointment.- Speakers: I'm not going to say they are fine, unfortunately, they are not, I didn't imagine that my 3 years old Lenovo Y510 would sound way much better than this laptop, I laughed when I heard the speakers because I thought it was a joke, yet most people use headphones for gaming or music, that's why I didn't take out a star at this point, and I'm using a Bluetooth JBL speaker during gaming.- Battery life: it lasts for 2.5 - 3 hours of office work and browsing in the best situation.Generally speaking, I'm loving this laptop even with the previously mentioned disadvantages especially (screen, speakers)This is the first laptop I use from MSI in my life, I am a Lenovo fan but it really worth the go, even with the current price of 900$ it really worth it, if you can ignore the screen and the speakers.Finally, I like this laptop and I am planning to keep it for the next 2 years.",2,0,1,2,2

144,"Got this as a refurb for a non-geek client who just needs it to be a working tool...so far so good. I am loving ChromeOS, so easy to learn and support. Folks spend more time in browsers than anywhere else and having something that mostly lives in the cloud helps to avoid backup procedures, supports versioning of documents and is easy to support. Essentially, we're back to remote terminals...and it's a good thing.But none of that's about this Chromebook, which is pretty doggone nice. The regular old HDMI jack is a plus...though I think Chromebooks all ought to use the new USB/C standard for charging, like most this one doesn't...and the simple power plug is easy to insert...unlike say a directional microUSB. The battery lasts all day, it's quiet and fast...",3,4,5,5,6

The screen looks amazing, and the touch is incredible especially for how slim the screen is. The keyboard is surrounded by amazing fabric that is light on your wrists while typing (no it doesn't stink and hasn't changed colors) and the keys with 1.5 mm travel feel like a premium keyboard.

I have had it looked at by 2 techs not including the Dell tech team. The Dell tech was very nice and she connected to my computer to try to find the problem or problems. She told me to keep a log to document any more anomalies. Here are the results from 10-25-17 to 11-15-17: 4 blue screens in 2 days, 7 more blue screens after that for a total of 11, and 1 freeze. That's 12 anomalies in 22 days. It was protected by Norton, In short, No more Dells for me.

Touchpad left clicks often do not work, take a lot of pressure, hard to find a good place to press to engage a non null click. Backlight on keyboard will often require several clicks of the f key to start working. Would have preferred a standard hdmi port. Tiny one on this computer is hard to use and seems like it is designed to wear out. Is slim, but is not light. I guess I expected it to be a little more friendly.

It's not the thinnest laptop in the world, but it's sturdy and has a nice texture. It converts to a tablet, which makes it even more versatile. This probably has the best battery of any laptop I've used. I can work all day on one charge, and when it's time to plug it in, it charges super-fast.

It is adjacent to the often used Delete, Backspace, and Home keys. Really? This passed their use case criteria? I often miss the Delete or Backspace keys and am accidentally putting my laptop into sleep. Several decades of best practices in designing laptops has led to this? Sigh. Deep. Sigh. Found the workaround at a CNET article. Since Amazon won't allow URL's in reviews, just Google ""Asus Vivobook power button"" and it will be the first link.2) Keyboard is not backlit. This should be a simple feature addition that is minor in terms of cost. Merely an LED and a light tube.

Screen gets the job done but it appears to be a very cheap TN panel and the color on the screen shifts severely depending on the angle you're viewing it at. It's still better than a majority of screens I've seen in this price range.Only complaint lies with the design of the area where my wrists sit below the keyboard. The edges are rather sharp and to compound the issue it's also the area where two pieces of plastic meet. This kinda makes it feel rough.

I don't really use it for heavy software, so I don't know how powerful it is for that.My main problem, though, is that sometimes the mousepad will stop working for a minute or two, or it will lag, but with my wireless mouse it's fine. It never lags or stops working. With the mousepad, I will try to right click but it will act like I intended to left click. It's frustrating, since I dont take my wireless mouse with me everywhere.Overall, I'm happy with it.",2,2,1,2,2
228,The description says it all this thing Is a beast. Remember this is a gaming laptop its big its definitely heavy and youll need a special bag to put it in.

229,"The Samsung Chromebook Plus is a phenomenal device. It's light, portable, beautiful craftsmanship, fast, and has a stunning display. For the majority of consumers, this device is all you will ever need for web browsing, media consumption, and now access to the Google Play Store and Android apps. I picked this up at a quarter of the price of my MacBook Pro, But it allows me to do just about everything I need it to do. There only criticism that I have is the non backlit keyboard, lacks HDR, and extended time to awake. This is without a doubt my favorite laptop of all time.

I needed an updated operating system, my Toshiba was more than 15 years old, it had the Vista OS and could only be updated to windows 7, I wanted windows 10. I didn't want anything big and thought after reading the reviews this might fit the bill. Well it certainly is small it's taking some getting use to. The key board seem to be cramped and no matter how I adjust it, the mouse pad is jumpy. All in all it's a nice notebook and after much thought, I started to give it to my grand children and get a more traditional laptop. I still might but I am getting use to this so I will see. I just need to remember to adjust from my work computer which is a Lonovo Think Pad.I'm giving it 4 stars because it's as described; portable and lightweight. It has limited memory but you can put in an SD card to add more. It only has 1 USB port but I already had a USB extension so I use that so no issue there. The color is gold and very pretty.

The kids have added amazon instant video, iTunes, and a few other fun things for their down time. This laptop does all of that very well.It was easy for me to set up. My regular laptop is a mac and I wasn't looking forward to setting up a pc but it was surprisingly intuitive. It walked me through the setup and I had it up and running in under 20 minutes. I was able to plug in our USB external disk drive which allowed it to be used to play movies with no problem.

The SSD is a new technology, which consequently must compensate for size. So, this new computers hard drive has about 240GB, which is, in fact, no bigger than my eight-year-old computer.

240,"2 Days InSo far so good. It's so light. Bought this to study off Khan academy and watch you tube and netflix. Tend to meet up with people at Starbucks/libraries/cafes. I had the fear of potential theft of my windows laptop while out and about so this seemed like the best choice as a daily carry machine. Messed around with the display at Best Buy and really liked it. The other reviews cover the pros and cons. I just needed this for the basics. Just got it, and I hope it won't have any issues like Shift keys sticking or wifi issues (so far none). Stylus hasn't been used much, so far. Touchscreen mostly which eliminates the need for a mouse (at least for me).Update June 19.17Watching Videos/SpeakersThe display was a major reason why I bought this machine (to watch anime/shows). If you turn the machine into a L shape, the speakers (which are at the bottom of the machine) are decent. Using the machine in an A shape (tent?) the speakers will muffle depending on the type of material you have the sound bouncing off. Like it will be muffled if its on the couch (fabric), therefore I bought a small wooden bamboo cutting board to place it on while I play my shows and that I can rotate as I wander around the room cleaning. Playing videos on high resolution did not work and took a long time to loading/buffering so I just lowered the quality.Stylus/Mouse/TrackpadI have been using the stylus more when in tent shape or tablet mode. I realized that I don't really need an external mouse since I have stylus on hand at all times. So, it might be a consideration if you are debating on buying a C to USB adaptor. The trackpad is responsive it's just taking a bit of getting used to the little differences like using 2 fingers to right click. I am not sure if there are settings for all of the Chromebook specific differences--I'm just using it as is.BatteryDepends what you use it for. I think 2-3.5 hours was the most I used the machine to continuously watch videos/youtube. (the battery also had not gone below 40%, I just prefer to keep my electronics charged above 50%). While studying and just browsing websites usage was 4-6 hours (depends if you are the type of person to recharge a machine rather than use it to 5% battery remaining)Cons: looking online, there aren't options for an alternative keyboard. I miss using swype, but using the touchscreen, keyboard, and voice search isn't a big issue, but might be for others.",2,4,5,4,5

The backlit keyboard is nice and it's a really fast computer. Love the extra storage for my games.

254,"I was using my school/work computer (which is rather large) as my personal computer and decided that I needed a separate PC for personal use which is why I purchased the ASUS E200HA. I'm using the ASUS for typing manuscripts, email, and general web browsing at home or at coffee shops. I'm a grad student (computational geneticist) so I do an excessive amount of typing, literature browsing, and emailing and this little ASUS works perfectly for those tasks. I purchased a separate 32Gb micro SD card to store literature and papers and so far so good. I will add that this computer was a warehouse deal and was purchased as ""very good"" condition and the item arrived with only one tiny little nick that is hardly noticeable. The previous owner must have updated to Windows 10 because startup was less than 10 minutes, with about 5 minutes of updates. I had to install the touchpad gesture features on the computer because they were missing, but installation took less than 5 minutes. Microsoft Office did not come installed, nor could I redeem the free 1-year trial, but I got the software for free through my University so it didn't concern me. I read reviews stating that updating to Windows 10 used up most of their computer's storage, but my computer arrived with about 16Gb of free storage. The issue after a recent Windows update is that the previous Windows files are kept as backup, but are automatically deleted in about a month. You can manually delete these files if you want which will free up a lot of space.Pros:Extremely lightweight and can carry around in one hand easily. I travel a lot to conferences and meetings and I'm definitely looking forward to not having to lug my heavy work laptop.Battery life lasts more than 6 hours. I never use it more than 4-5 hours at a time without charging so I don't know how long it actually lasts, but it indicates 11+ hours of charge time.Surprisingly responsive and snappy. I've read negative reviews about it crashing and bogging down, but that isn't the case with mine. I have Chrome installed, which is a ram hog, but the pages load quickly and YouTube videos stream without any lag.Very sleek and nice design! It actually looks like it costs twice as much!Screen is good and fair. It does have bad viewing angles, but its not a deal breaker if you don't mind adjusting the lid.Cons:The keyboard is a little bit spongy and doesn't rebound as fast, but you can type decently by pressing a little harder. The keys are also small and spaced out which looks cool but a tad unnecessary given the lack of space.The touchpad is not always consistent and the soft clicking response works best in certain areas. The hard clicking is easiest towards the bottom of the touchpad, and not so much near the top. You may want to invest in a good mouse.BIG CON is the two nubs that stick out behind the lid. You cant open the lid while the computer is resting on a flat surface without the nubs digging at the surface. The computer doesn't rest on all four rubber feet when the lid is open, instead it rests on the front two feet and the two lid nubs (or whatever you want to call them) -- really annoying.Overall great little laptop that is perfect for college students who do not need a computer for heavy processing like excel, video and photo editing, or gaming. Perfect for web browsing, video streaming, Microsoft Word, or as a second device for travel. Would recommend!",3,1,5,4,3

I use an Acer laptop normally; it has a dvd drive, bunch of ports - it's heavy. So much so I dread taking it on the plane.But this thing - it's super light and thin.-So - who's it meant for? Small hard drive. But it functions like a laptop.-Kids. This laptop is for kids. Hence, my niece. Downloading a few apps, watching youtube incessantly - this is what the new generation uses laptops for. They don't need office or power or big displays. Heck, this screen is giant compared to the tiny phones they squint at all day long. So - keeping that in mind - this works well for that.-Do you have kids you need to keep quiet at home? In the car? On the plane? This'll work (provided you have an internet connection, which is mandatory for this laptop - otherwise it's pretty worthless.).-It's only two hundred bucks.

260,"I hate this laptop. HATE it. I never write reviews but felt compelled to do it about this piece of junk. And I'm writing this from my phone instead of my laptop, so that, in itself, should tell you a lot.This is my second ASUS laptop, my first one did not work out of the box, so after a few hours with tech support, I was told to send it back for a new placement.My second laptop (the one I am using now) will not connect to my WiFi. We have 10 other devices that connect with no problem. After spending hours troubleshooting, I purchased an Ethernet cable and decided to just call next with the cable to the router. Bought the cable, only to realize there is no Ethernet port on the laptop. So I had to purchase a USB converter to be able to Plug the cable to the laptop. This uses up 1 of the 2 USB ports on the laptop. My wireless mouse uses the other (because the touchpad on this thing is horribly obnoxious.) I have no extra USB ports to charge my phone, plug in my printer, nothing.Ok. So that's enough of a pain in the butt. My laptop doesn't have wireless. My portable computer isn't that portable. Fine.Now, after a few months of use, the power cable, which never fit snugly to begin with, won't work at all. So now, I'm waiting on my purchase of a new power cable. Hopefully that fixes it, or the laptop will be completely useless.I would not recommend this thing to anyone. I should've just lit the money I spent on it on fire and watched it burn. Would've saved me the agrravation of dealing with this thing. Which, as of today, is a very expensive paperweight.The laptop is cute and small. That's about the only positive of this piece of garbage,",3,1,5,4,3

With all the research we did before purchase, it was never brought to our attention that Chrome 45 and later no longer support Java, thus making it impossible for him to log on everyday.Therefore we had to return this laptop so that we can repurchase one that does support JAVA, since it is such a critical part of his curriculum.Which was unfortunate, besides the problem stated above it seemed to be a perfect fit for us, him, and our wallet.",2,2,5,4,3
264,"I absolutely love this product, and would easily give it 5 stars for what it is. It does everything it is supposed to do while being very lightweight, versatile, and looking sleek.You need to understand what it is though. A chromebook is not a computer. It can run all google applications and a large portion of the googleplay store. It is more than perfect for me as a student, but it is not for you if you are looking for an art tablet or a gaming tablet. For the price, it is rather steep, but I feel that it is justified with this build quality.The battery life is not as advertised however, as it lasts anywhere from 2-6 hours depending on what you are doing. Playing games drains it very fast, while browsing the web lets it run all day basically.Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase, and if you have the money and it meets your needs, I recommend it to you as well.8/2/17 EDIT: I AM HAVING HUGE ISSUES WITH THIS THING.First off, before I explain, I treat my electronics, this included, with as much care as possible (I worked my ass off for the money!), and as such, this has never been dropped, hit, or damaged in any way whatsoever. It has always been handled carefully and is in perfect condition, so these are all software issues.The touchscreen is buggy. Very buggy. Usually a few hours a day (in a full day of use) the screen freaks out. It acts as though it is being randomly touched in random places sporadically and it is entirely unusable when it is like this. Restarting it solves the issue for a few minutes only. It's impossible to get through a movie as it randomly pauses it and unpauses it- and a movie is long enough that the issue WILL occur sometime during it.The Bluetooth struggles big time. It is very easy to ""connect"" to a speaker or headset. You put the item in pairing mode, and click on it on this laptop. In a moment, it say's ""connected."" But it isn't. It isn't connected at all. With any and all bluetooth devices (I've tested 6-7) it takes anywhere from 2-20 (yes, twenty) minutes to get it to work. The only effective way of doing this to unpair it in the settings, and set it up as a new device. This takes an annoying amount of time. Oh hey, my screen just started glitching again. I guess that means I should hurry this up.After checking online, these issues seem to be somewhat common, and yet Samsung customer support is useless telling me to reset the device even though I specifically made it clear that that didn't work the first 3 times. So it's not just me.Also, it doesn't have a caps button. Only a search button in its place that opens up google search. Stupid feature. It can be remapped in the settings.Taking off 3 stars for all of these new issues. I would give it 0 if I didn't love it so much when functioning. However rare that is.",2,4,5,4,5

The screen is very bright easy to read, and the 4:3 ratio actually works very well on a device this size.My only criticism is that working with larger .docx files (around 2.5mb) does tend to be a bit laggy, whether you use Word Online or Docs. Shutting down Chrome and using the just Android version of Docs worked a bit better. Don't ask this system to do too much at once.Dollar for dollar, this was a better buy than any of the Windows 10 laptops I could have bought in Australia, since the Chrome OS is so resource-light. My main criteria were high portability and enough battery life to get me through a 5-6 hour tabletop gaming session, and the Chromebook ticks both of those boxes nicely.Note for anyone considering this device outside of the US and Canada: the charger is rated for 110v - 240v, so as long as your mains supply falls within that range you should only need a socket adaptor.

This makes 3 times I've turned in this sort of device as not ready for prime time. I'll try again in a few years.

328,"This is a very short, initial impression review. If my opinion changes, I'll update or write a separate review. I am on the fence about this laptop...I HATE the keyboard. I have missed strokes in every single sentence. You have to put an incredible amount of pressure on the keys to register a stroke, and the keys that are struck with the pinkies are especially difficult to get a good hit. It actually feels like I am typing on one of the old manual typewriters, if anyone remembers those. I have to go back and retype sentences constantly because of the missing letters. Occasionally, I will have double strikes with the same letter being typed twice.Another thing that irritated me about this laptop was the length of time it took to load up. It is expected for a brand new laptop to have updates available - it probably sat in a box in a warehouse for months, so updates have been released since it was manufactured. But, it literally took 90 minutes for this thing to download and install all of the updates. It was quite annoying.The battery is lackluster at best. It will last around 3 hours, which I suppose is not bad, but I was hoping for more. I suppose I could get a larger cell battery.Check your warranty online. Go to the Lenovo website and register your machine. I did, and it said that the warranty had been initiated in January of 2017, which is puzzling, because I just received it on 03 September 2017. I did an online chat with a customer service specialist and was told that ""this happens all the time.""Perhaps the most irritating thing about this laptop, even more irritating than the keyboard that I HATE, is the connectivity to WiFi. I do not have cable, so I watch movies and videos on my smart TV. I also have my cell phone connected to my WiFi while I'm home. Neither of those devices ever drop the WiFi signal, but this laptop does. Constantly. If I put the laptop in sleep mode...or even if I just don't touch it for a while, it will disconnect. When I try to get back on the computer, I have to manually connect to WiFi. Half the time, literally, it will not connect. It will show that there is no internet access. So, I will have to go into the settings and ""forget"" my router, then re-register it, entering the password again. I've done this MULTIPLE times since I received the laptop on Sunday. Today, no matter what I did, it simply would not connect. So, I had to unplug my router and allow it to fully reset. The computer finally connected at that point, but it shouldn't have taken that because both my phone and TV were connected and functioning the entire time.One last note......this review began with a 3-star rating, but the more I cataloged the problems I am having, and the more I had to type on this DREADFUL keyboard, the more irritated I got. So, it's now a 2-star rating.Find a better laptop.",2,1,1,2,2
329,"When you purchase this laptop, allow yourself a full day to set it up. First you will need about 3 hours to charge the battery, then Windows updates will take a couple of hours. Then it will take some time to get rid of the junk that all new computers come with (I'm not a gamer, so lots of games had to go). If you are a Windows 10 pro, then you should be good to go. The last Windows computer I had was XP, so Win 10 took a while to get used to. I won't trade my Mac for anything, but I was at the point where I needed a new laptop to take on appointments with clients, and since they are all PC users it only made sense to go with a Windows machine.The computer isn't really gold at all, but more of a silvery color. I was worried that it would be flashy and ""in your face"" gold, but it is very subtle.The caps lock button doesn't let you know it is on, and that can get annoying when you accidentally hit it. There is also no separate numerical keypad, but maybe that is normal for laptops. I am more of a desktop user.Fingerprint technology is great, although about half the time it doesn't recognize me the first time and I have to do it again. Still, much faster than typing a password. Startup is super fast, literally only a few seconds. I was initially only looking for a $400 or so laptop since this won't get much use, but I am glad I splurged and got something with a much better processor and a SSD for the operating system.This laptop weighs next to nothing, and the screen is about the thickness of a few pieces of cardstock. Really, it's very impressive. I am still on my first battery charge, and have probably gotten 5-6 hours out of it, but it is warning me now that it is low.The only downside so far is no DVD drive. But I picked up an external Asus Zen Drive (SDRW-08U7M-U) for $29 and it works great. I don't need it often, but my iMac doesn't have a drive either, so now I am all set for both computers since it is plug and play.Overall, I'm very impressed and glad that I chose this model out of the 40+ I looked at on amazon before deciding. I was worried that it wouldn't have enough RAM, and apparently your warranty is void if you put more in. But so far it is very adequate. If, after trying to run Photoshop and a bunch of other programs all at once it seems to be lagging, then I will update my review.",2,2,1,2,2

332,"Good device, but not for everyone.To start off, it runs chrome OS, obviously, with the first integration of the playstore. My current internet had trouble connecting but thats hard to tell if thats just my bad internet or something with the device itself. It ran videos smooth and they looked amazing on the high resolution display, so i can definitely offer this a media consumption device, but at a near $500 you look for more. I tried gaming with some android games which for the most part ran smooth and without any hiccups however the touchscreen isn't optimal and it has a lot of resistance when trying to slide your thumb on it, which felt rough and frankly uncomfortable. Typing on this keyboard felt good and i found myself typing up to speed in no time. It has very good travel and a nice curve. Typing documents or essays on this thing would be incredibly doable. The main reason i got this unit was for the built in stylus, which being a samsung galaxy note user for years, caught my eye. It was a good size for me personally, about medium sized hands, and it was comfortable to draw with. Unfortunately most drawing apps didnt have a palm rejection and neither does the chromebook, so when i would rest my hand on the device it would usually start drawing where my hand touched as well. Otherwise it was good to draw with. I sought for a way to get linux or windows on this device but unfortunately it uses an arm chipset, which until later this year when microsoft comes out with a new arm windows that can emulate full software, chrome os is all you'll get.Overall the device was nice, felt good to hold in the hands and a crisp display. As a secondary media consumption or document writer it makes sense. If you are looking for something to do a bit more, look at other options that can fit your budget, at the end of the day, the limitations of chrome os are too great to keep this as an everyday driver.",2,4,5,4,5
333,"I replaced my 6 pound i7 gaming laptop with this. Now, that's not to say this can do EVERYTHING an i7 with a gtx 1060 can do. But at two pounds and with a good 8 hours of battery life I can take it a lot more places, and do almost everything I used to do. Runs Chrome (obviously) like a champ, and will play most Android games as fast or faster than a phone or tablet. WIth full support for the Android store that also means you can run the Office apps, and more to get a little productivity in as well. Run it most often in ""tent"" mode when gaming, and that is more helpful than you might believe. The stylus support is als a much better deal than I had expected.

In addition to this, keyboard is exceptionally small in compassion to most 12"" laptops, the delete key is half the size of the other keys and the entire screen is square not rectangle shaped the stock photo makes it look normal like a Macbook shape but it is not.

So in the last 6 months we've used it a handful of times, using it for the last 20 minutes it has already dropped 20% in battery life. 1% per minute!!! What a joke!

Click on a button or hyperlink and it launches Cortana. Hit a pulldown menu, it launches Cortana. I've tried multiple times to change the sensitivity of the touch pad to no avail.

371,"This laptop straight out of the box will not work for most people as it has many problems and all related to Microsoft and not Lenovo the Laptop itself. You will need a Tech like my son to fix these problems. The Resources or CPU 85% RAM 30% HDD 100% out of the box on idle. After my son fixed it, Resources is CPU 0% Ram 22% HDD 0% on idleMicrosoft1) When first turning it on and completing the setup, Windows will want to do an update and then it get's stuck on this part. I let it run for 8 hours and it would not finish the download as the problem is with Microsoft Update Assistance. So I hard shut down the computer and performed a clean boot of Windows 10 from my USB flash drive and this fixed the update problem and it only took me about 20 minutes to complete the new install of Windows with almost all new updates. It only had about 6 updates to do but only took about 15 minutes to complete those.2) Then all drivers were installed and firmware's.3) Two more problems caused the HDD to max out at 100% is (Problem A) Windows Store kept downloading apps that I did not won't and I uninstalled a couple of times but kept redownloading. So I performed a registry tweak and fixed that problem. (Problem B) Windows Superfetch, this is a known problem that has been around for many years and most people can disable it but it prevents the computer from loading programs into memory making it faster at launching those programs. If I wait 1-2 minutes after Windows finishes booting up, Superfetch will return to normal. So I did not disable it.4) Windows Defender causes the HDD to max out at 100% so by installing a different Antivirus software fixes this problem as it will disable Windows Defender but you need an AV that isn't a resource hog too.

I like how the hinges are made and hopefully they will not break like other laptops. I am surprised how light weight this laptop is. It does come with a side keypad and a CD/DVD drive which is what I wanted. The graphic card is very good and I can play games if I want to as long as it's not a high-end game. The Keyboard doesn't have backlight which I love because it causes a glare with my eyes and I can't see the keys. Huge Hard Drive which is overkill for myself as I use local and online backup storage. Lots of Ram at 8GB which I really like along with the AMD A12 processor at 2.7GHz with turbo to 3.4GHz. I am a fan of AMD verses Intel because they are cheaper but can still keep up with Intel. I didn't pay much for this laptop because it was on sale plus I used my rewards points but it was still a very good off-sale price for what it comes with.This is my first Lenovo laptop as I always bought HP in the past.",1,4,1,3,2

375,"As the keyboard, ease of updating, and computer speed are very important characteristics for a computer, I opted to reset the HP to factory condition and returned it, and ordered the Dell Inspiron 1550 instead.I needed to replace two ASUS laptops that were manufactured back when they had a well-earned reputation for keyboard and display 'issues.' My partner wanted the Dell Inspiron 1550, and I thought I'd try this HP being half a pound lighter and except for the fingerprint scanner on the Dell, had the same processing power. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like the more lightweight laptop, it was simply junk compared with the Dell which was only about $20 more expensive. The display on the HP was grainy, the Dell HD. The HP has a mic, the Dell has stereo mics. Dell has a great fingerprint scanning option, the HP did not. The keyboard on the Dell had easy to read and well-spaced keys, with or without the backlight. The HP's keys were difficult to distinguish from one another, with the light from underneath being brighter than the keys, and very narrow spacing between them.Last, the breaking point that had me stop setting up the HP, was that with each required update, the Dell was consistently twice as fast and each update was easily accomplished. Several updates on The HP, for some reason, kept completely failing, requiring extra hours for the update.",3,2,1,2,2

377,Terrible Laptop. Windows that came with it was not authenticating. After buying a new Windows License it worked for around a month and now it won't boot up. It keeps going into automatic repair. Over the course of the month performance was slow and MS Word kept crashing. I have tried to factory reset it and it doesn't work.

380,"I was looking for a laptop that would be easy to use for digital art and inexpensive. However, I clearly was unaware of how awful the Google Drive service is. I lost lots of work on Google Docs not a week after purchasing this laptop, even though the internet connection was strong. It takes forever to transfer and move files around. The drawing program is called ArtCanvas, it's okay but still inconvenient- no way to add text, etc.Additionally, these Chromebooks are supposed to be virus-proof. I was doing clothes shopping and have gotten a pop-up every time I use my laptop, despite adding the website to my block list and never actually ordering anything from the site.Frankly, this laptop is a waste of money and energy. It's alright just for watching videos, but as other people have mentioned the sound quality is terrible. I can't recommend this computer. I had an HP laptop for the past 5 years which was much better. This system is poorly designed and slower than it should be.During the time it took for me to write this review, I was waiting for a file in google drive to transfer to another folder.

I was impressed the light weight, compactness and general speed of the machine. Also, IPS screen is just brilliant. Makes me hate my work laptop (Dell E7270). LG did not pack that much bloat software on it and I only had to uninstall some unnecessary software. With machines like this around it really makes you wonder how Apple sells it's Airbooks anymore.

392,This is a great laptop and I would give it 5 stars except for one thing. I do wish ASUS had not installed Mcafee. It is part of the system and automatically reminds you to renew once your 'trial' subscription has ended.

There's nothing cheap or flimsy about it. I read other reviews about a noisy fan, but I'm not hearing it and my hearing is very good. Maybe it was a later improvement on the model? I don't know, but this thing is as silent as it gets. Seriously, this is a very nice computer. Yes, there is no DVD drive, but you can buy one to USB attach for less than $40, so that shouldn't be too big of a deal. And, oh yeah, a very good keyboard.

It's incredibly slow for even the most basic things and it has next to no storage space for any apps, documents, programs, photos, etc. I have problems with ""blue screens"" now - it randomly shuts down and must restart because of an unspecified ""problem with my PC.""

The SSD's can be upgraded/replaced independently, although you may have to remove RAID settings before it will recognize the SSD. Not removing RAID settings will make the SSD undetectable, but is an easy fix.The annoying BIOS startup sound can be disabled in the BIOS settings.Maybe it was just a mistake on my part, but despite being a 17-inch laptop, it does not fit in a 17 inch case or at least not the brand I purchased. An 18-inch case will work though..I have only had one instance where the keyboard stopped working entirely, requiring a force shutdown to resolve the issue.

411,"Overall, the laptop works well while having an appealing design -- however, there are many different factors that will make you hate this computer. First, the graphics are terrible -- even with Intel integrated graphics, the computer cannot manage to perform tasks that are simple in terms of graphical demand. While the computer can run videos on YouTube, it cannot manage to run Netflix (I have 150mbps, so it is not due to my internet connection). The image usually appears extremely blurry, and there is nothing you can do to resolve this issue. Secondly, the speakers sound average at best, but the major issues are due to the speaker's location, which is directly under the computer -- you must have the computer on a straight, solid surface in order to hear the sound -- placing your laptop on your bed or carpet will make the sound very difficult to hear. Thirdly, the battery life is terrible -- if I'm doing the slightest amount of work on my computer, the battery is dead within 1-3 hours. Lastly, if you are into gaming, this computer fails in every category. Obviously, this computer is not designed to handle gaming, but playing games that are very basic, two dimensional, and primitive can barely run. On the plus side, this laptop will fulfill all of your basic needs (Word, PowerPoint, email, small projects, video chat).To reiterate, here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Lightweight- Attractive Design- Performs Small Application Very Well- Light-Up Keyboard- Easy-To-Type Keyboard- Can Handle Programming- Overall Reliable- Thin DesignCons:- Highly Overpriced- Fails To Run Many Applications- Bad Battery Life- Graphics Are Terrible And Replacing The Graphics Card Will Not Help Much (It Is The Computer Itself)- Cannot Be Used For Entertainment Purposes (Netflix, Gaming)",2,2,1,2,2

Before installing your software, first try to update windows 10, otherwise you cannot find enough space to updating. After you finish the update, close the windows update service and also windows search service then install all your software. Without doing this please do not complain about its speed. By the way it is better to disable windows search and windows update from windows services. Otherwise you cannot use this laptop even for 1 day.",3,1,5,4,3

446,"As reviewed: i5-8520U, 8GB DDR4 RAM and 1TB FireCuda Hybrid DriveI am very happy with this little laptop. Now I'm a person who can't stand the current trend towards tablets and touchscreens. I'm an engineering student and have a powerful desktop setup with two 21:9 monitors and regularly use both when I'm doing homework. I'm bothered by little details and expect higher performance than the average user. I needed a laptop to bring to my internship and carry with me to classes so I started looking for a small laptop with decent specs. For me this laptop matched everything I needed at a reasonable price.The main selling points for me were:-Small portable size-1080p ips screen-Decent cpu-Traditional layout-Subjectively a nice lookOnce I got my hands on it I had some thoughts on it. I was pleasantly surprised by how rigid the chassis feels despite being plastic. When I first started using it I wasn't sure I'd like the track pad, but in use I haven't noticed it at all, it's functioned exactly how I want it to. I consider the keyboard to be good, I'd prefer a more clicky experience but I can't fault anything about it. I feel fast and accurate typing on it. I installed Linux Mint on it and it runs perfectly without tweaking. The only feature that doesn't work on Mint is the fingerprint scanner. The hybrid drive is tolerable, not as quick as an SSD but I'm not bothered by it. The speakers have a decent sound for a laptop, albeit a higher max volume would be nice.In conclusion this laptop offered everything I wanted at a reasonable price. The functionality is on par with more premium offerings and it still maintains a solid build quality and good looks.

452,"Updated on 6/13/2018 w/photos, & info on the caddySo just a general update, disappointed with the external caddy. Doesn't work, had it worked i would have adapted it to fit in the torn down frostcore frame while maintaining the existing fan and just essentially rewiring it to work with also the M2 SSD port. Photos included regarding the taredown of both the frostcore and the caddy i mentioned in my original review.Also a few screenshots of the most updated software and graphics drivers that were critical (along with the wireless driver that resolves the hibernate/sleep issue also causing BSOD/wireless reciever crap out due to faulty driver/win10 update that broke things). NOTE Updating your drivers to the latest at least in my case resolved all BSOD issues.A suggestion, get a crucial/micron M2 SSD. They come with a free license to do backups/cloned images which to me, is a awesome deal for a ssd (256gb) that only costed me $12 when i bought mine.Updated on 6/12/2018 w/photos, and some extra informationOnly updated to provide photos, Will later on this week provide more updates. Looks like i may have made a error in ordering a external caddy that supports both a fan to vent, and a M2 SSD slot. May need to do some hardware modifications due to what seems to be proprietary lock/eject mechanism that is for the Acer Predator series, ontop of the non flush based external caddy. If anyone has ANY insight on where to buy actual optical drive caddy bays that have M2 SSD slot(s)/Extra fan with SATA connections, please please please post under my review with a link to the product.Reviewed on 6/11/2018:First and foremost this really got on my nerves. The Acer Predator G9-793-73MB GTX 1060 Model DOES NOT come with more than 1x 256gb M2 SSD, and 1x 1TB HDD. What isn't mentioned is that the GTX 1060 MODEL of the G9-793 series only has 1 M2 SSD bay (the secondary slot is not even on the board). Confirmed this with acer premium support, as well as literally just opening up my laptop's HDD/SSD bay to visually confirm). So if you want the Raid 0 configuration that basically means you have 2x 128gb M2 SSDs, you either need to buy the G9-793-MB GTX 1070 Model OR Buy the G9-793-73MB GTX 1060 and buy a SSD-M2/SSD Laptop Internal DVD Optical Drive Bay 2nd M.2 NGFF SSD Caddy which one i am waiting on delivery for to test which is found here --> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076WZBC8X/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and slot in your M2 SATA while also keeping the cooling fan mechanism. FYI I haven't tested this yet and am waiting on product to arrive as of this writing, but this pretty much effectively tells me if i am gonna want this model the 1060 or if im gonna return this model and get the 1070 (Graphically speaking the 1070 is what you want assuming you can afford it) but for me the 1060 fits my needs all but the Lack of the 2nd M2 Bay/connector which is NOT mentioned ANYWHERE on any of their product pages, or acers technical sheet/manuel/amazon questions/acer forums.All in all the Keyboards RGB (4 segment RGB) is what prompted me to buy this laptop over the more portable variant the Acer Predator Helios 300 (with the 1060gtx)which only has the red backlit keyboard, where as the Acer predator 15' and 17' model supports a external enclosure as well as RGB editing (configured through the predatorsense app).The venting on this thing is amazing. I personally enable the fans to run at max when doing anything intensive or GPU heavy, and never need to push the hardware to the point of overheating. The Frostcore is more of a gimmick, but it does help reduce SOME of the heat (about 5-9% of the heat) of the laptop when its working at max load while over clocked. By the WAY, overclocked on a gtx 1050-1070 WILL literally eat through your battery while on Turbo mode for both the GPU being overclocked through predatorSense as well as the CPU being overclocked (and taxed at 100% cpu & 100% gpu) utilization. Helping keep this laptop quite cool even under heavy load.Love the fact this one came with a Samsung SSD, bought another 256gb SSD same day i purchased the laptop so everything would arrive, thats when i had found out what i mentioned being my major irk. So when the Laptop Internal DVD Optical Drive Bay 2nd M.2 NGFF SSD Caddy arrives ill beable to throw in the other 256gb SSD and go from there. I'll update this review once i get it and verify & test it (given it also has a built in fan which basically looks identical to the one in the frostcore minus all the fancy coloring and presentation) ill update that as well. Wanna test out how the predatorsense program senses the 3rd party ""M2/SSD-Frostcore"" Combo (where this time its not called frostcore)All and all the 16gb of RAM is fine for me, but im probably gonna upgrade it to 64gb with 16gb RAM chips (4x in total) later on depending on how much ram ill need. Realistically, ill need no more than 8gb, and 16gb is plenty even for a majority of what i do, which is gaming/minor server configuring/testing. The C-Force CF003 USB 3.1 DOES work with the Acer Predator G9-793-73MB GTX 1060 (6gb) for routing HDMI audio/video through the Hub. As a added bonus works with nintendo switch, and other USB C/Thunderbolt equipped devices (the hub) that is. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BX96YNV/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 I am able to confirm that the Acer Predator 17 Model G9-793-73MB does work with the usb C (thunderbolt) for HDMI out, as well as a usb 3.1x hub. Same concept, the arrows MUST be pointing upwards (visible to you when plugged in) on the CF003 on the laptops USB C connector as well as the arrow aligned on the CF003. BIG side note, you can actually also have the arrow pointing downward on the USB C port on the pc, AND the CF003 (Just make sure the arrow ISNT aligned with the arrow) and it will work. Same thing for the nintendo switch. Haven't tested the adaptor with a straight USB C to USB C connector (reverse/same side) connector yet though. I wanted to mention the part about the Thunderbolt USB C port supporting any format adaptor that is USB C to Output adaptor given the Technical manual provided by acer DOES STATE that only a Thunderbolt USB C to Display adaptor is the only thing supported (it does not explicitly state that any other digital video out is unsupported, as well as if audio out is unsupported) pretty vague on acers site as well as what their techs know given how vague the answer is in the literal technical manual. Also the Thunderbolt USB C port DOES NOT support reverse charging IE, you can't use that port to charge your laptop battery. Just won't work. I can completely confirm that i can hook up 2x monitors at the same time on the laptop (through the built in HDMI/Display port & using the thunderbolt port) while also keeping the laptops own screen in active service (That makes it 3 monitors active same time), i think you can do a 3rd one with the Display port, making it a total of 3 external monitor/tv devices & the existing built in laptop screen making it a total of 4 display devices altogether. I need more monitors to confirm this (only have 2 at the moment) so anyone who can test and confirm this, that would be good to know regarding the model G9-793-73MB GTX 1060/1070 for the Acer Predator 17' series. BIG key notes to keep in mind for the ending part of this review, UPDATE all the drivers manually including the software. PredatorSense, the BIOS, KillerWifi (drivers & management application), Nvidia GTX xxxx (where x = model of GPU) because if you DO NOT update these things manually win10 will update them for you, and you will find out your machine will literally suffer from BSOD (Blue screen of death) Due to read/write errors or some other randomness caused by the win10 updates. DO NOT trust win10 updates for everything this is how you effectively kill your machine slowly through trusting microsoft to apropriately load the right drivers for you (which will be what causes the BSOD, at least in my case on multiple reimaged tests of win10 home x64 and win10 pro x64). Another noteable thing about this, is that even though it is windows 10 home x64, it is NOT PRO, meaning you don't have the features available. The laptop DOES NOT support win10 x64 PRO the normal way, you need to buy the license for win10 pro, and then from ground up re-install the win10 OS (win10 pro x64) and then manually reinstall all the specially loaded software to get the laptop to a win10 pro x64 licensed copy. This laptop DOES NOT allow you to do win10 store purchase/upgrade to win10 pro, some weird technical glitch that i could not get any direct confirmation from microsoft stating that the laptop does not explicitly support the pro edition of win10 x64. I will upload photos/videos/links to the apropriate drivers later on when i recieve the other last component for the laptop as well as correct any spelling errors, and resummarize my experience with the hardware and further test out the device.IF you are going to buy this laptop keep a watchful eye on it, i've seen its price fluxuate well over 200-500+ off deals through amazon directly (not 3rd party sellers), and it is constantly in a state of flux. I Bought the laptop for $1,349 USD. You may buy it for more/less depending on what time you do, do the purchase to lock in that lower price. Sometimes the 1060 is the better deal, othertimes the 1070 is being sold for lower than the 1060. Lots of confusion with amazon on this process so just a general FYI regarding purchasing this predator laptop model.",2,0,1,0,1

460,"The real grabber is the 13.5-inch screen resolution of 2256 X 1504;it catches yur attenion and won't let go. Your eyes will be attractedto it as if there was a magnetic pull.Then we proceed to a possible deal-breaker, the operating system.Win10S (S for Student) has security upgrades, but sprouted warts;you are limited to software packages available from MicroSoftApp store only. The corporate honchos believe this restriction willmaintain security, and to an extent, they may be correct.You will discover that Chrome will not run, while MS Edge will.Thus, you must make adjustments to Win10S; it will not accomodateall your wishes.Upgrade to Win10 Pro is an option for an additional $50, although it ispresently a free option. The Surface pen is a $99.99 extra-costaddition that was once included in earlier Surface versions. Strangely,Adobe apps can't run in Surface, so your creativity might be stuntedby this restriction.Sound reproduction is excellent, a real surprise considering Surface'sultra-thin case. Audio is really enhanced when the Surface resides ona wooden table.Another plus is the striking cosmetics of Surface - gorgeous. TheAlcantara fabric on the console is a matter of personal taste; it mightenhance your experience; it certainly won't detract from it.Surface is ideal as a portable, take anywhere laptop with functionalityof a tablet.

Touchpad performance has really improved the pastdecade. Tracking is precise, and clicks are positivem and no more wanderingcursors.Will Win10S become the academic operating system of choice? Theanswer is entirely dependent on cost. The Surface will set you backapproximately $1200. I cannot imagine too many school districtsbacking programs forcing parents to pony-up that much for a laptop-tablet hybrid, especially with an operating system that cannot runmany user apps. Students won't appreciate that encroachment ontheir liberties.Bottom line: Win10S has superior security features, but uers candownload and run only MicroSoft App store distros.

461,"I got burned on the original Surface when it came out (I had an RT which was horrible, so I traded for a Pro with Win8). That Surface got slower and slower with its many, many updates, to where the system was so bogged down that it was unusable. On top of that, hardware challenges began to show after a few weeks and by month three I loved it a lot less than on Day One. So I waited a few months before reviewing this laptop to see if it had similar issues.Fortunately, Microsoft seems to have ironed out a lot of the issues. This laptop may not have all the cool-hip factor of a convertible tablet, but its full-sized keyboard and solid casing are eminently practical while its feather weight and ultra-slim profile still keep it in the fashionably-cool category. Mine has and i5 processor and 8GB of RAM and that seems adept at most things I do (it's only a little sluggish with some games like Forza 6 and with Access). Were I chronically trying to do either, I would splurge for the i7/16GB, but the entry set will work for most tasks.The keyboard is responsive. My only gripe is my 30-year history of right-handed Control+Enter is busted by this keyboard's layout, which replaces the right control key with a menu key and no easy way to re-map it. It is backlight, but more a hint of backlit than my VAIO or Alienware, which actually makes it more eye-friendly in the dark. The large track pad is very responsive and reads the full range of touch and swipe options (some of which are turned off my default - weird).The aluminum case is sharp looking, though my dented pretty easily while in my laptop bag with my mouse. The power cord attach is magnetic, with a bar clip that makes aligning it a snap (ba da ch!). I will say the battery default power setting lets it drain pretty quickly, so if you're like me and use yours while flying, you may consider switching to lower-power options (this gets me from about 6 hours of heavy use to 12 - a nice leap, especially considering it's not the fastest charging device).Finally, for what it's worth: I do not like Win10S any more than I liked Win8RT. I know it makes the system lighter, faster, and more Android/iOS-ish, but it also makes it impossible to run my work software, any legacy software, and just in general I reject the idea (been using Microsoft since the DOS 3.0 days, so I guess I'm stuck in the mindset of me telling my computer what it will do, not the other way around). So for my 2 cents, just upgrade to full Windows 10 when you get it. The upgrade is free for the remainder of 2017, and only $50 beginning in 2018 (purchase via the Windows Store).",0,2,3,2,4

I turned it on, it uploaded updates, told it I preferred English and selected Express Config instead of Custom. It didn't take long. Quickly it asked me to log into Microsoft or set up an account. I got half of my email address enter and the screen went black. I can see the mouse, that's it. Left it alone, nothing. Rebooted, nothing. I open the warranty booklet and it says to go to their website for customer support info. Seriously. What if this was my only computer? Luckily, I have a phone I can look it up, but my mother doesn't. What would she do. So I look it up, hoping its an easy fix. One quick phone call and I'm ready to go for the weekend. Woot. But I won't know until next week because their support desk is only open Mon-Fri. Seriously. There is an email address and I can leave a message, which is nice. But how freaking frustrating. If/when I get the computer to function I will update this to a review of the actual product. But since I can't use it, all I can review is a complete lack to contact anyone today about the computer that didn't work basically out of the box.UPDATE: Several hours later it occurred to me to go to their website. Not the one they put in the warranty book, their normal site. I found a live chat there. It took over an hour to get someone, but then it was in fact the simple fix I hoped for. Hard reboot while holding F2. Yay. So, I'm still mildly annoyed by the whole process, but I have a laptop now.

481,"I am a previous owner of a ASUS UX31A that I bought in mid 2013. It finally wore out, I liked it so bought this one as a replacement. Though it is fine there are a few unadvertised changes that irk me. First, this one does not open nearly as much as the UX31A. The UX31A would open almost 150 degrees, this one only to about 130 degrees. I have already run into operating situations where this I miss the old spec. For instance if the laptop is on a kitchen counter and you are standing to use it -- you really want that extra opening angle. Second, the UX31A power supply was made so the two prongs would fold back into the body of the power cube. This was great when you threw it into your carry case so the prongs would not poke into anything. Not so with this new one. They stick out and that's it. The UX31A came with a slip case. Not this one. Finally the speakers on the UX31A were on a bar in front of the function keys. On this one they come out the bottom of the case. Sound can be muffled.

489,"So, this is a honest review on the Aspire 1.The notebook is fast, with the Celeron N3450, browsing, loading speed etc are good. The 4GB RAM plays a nice role here for a budget computer. You can use this notebook to work such as programming, office things and of course for educational purposes if you are a student. This notebook is NOT for advanced image and video editing or 3D thing. In fact, heavy software like Photoshop etc must not be installed. The notebook is too basic for these tools in terms of system requirements. You get Office 365 pre-installed as a trial period. However, I removed it for LibreOffice. Moreover, regarding the screen, it is NOT an IPS display. The display is matt but you can play a little with the saturation if you want. However, I leave it like it is, I do not have any issue. The sound is not that best performance, but it is good. The keyboard is good, responsive.The only ssue is the storage which is a 32GB eMMC and you get around 15GB left de to pre-installed Windows Home. I will gve you few tips how to get more storage as follows:-Once you buy the notebook, the first thing to do is to UPDATE the Windows Home. Download all updates and install until no updates are available.-After successfully updating the notebook, free the space by removing the previous version of the Windows. It will save you around 2.5GB.-Now, uninstall all pre-installed tools you will not use.-Then, install your software you will use.-Clean registries, junk files and cache from browser.If you still need storage, then use an external Hard drive.The battery is OK. If WIFI is ON, and if you are just browsing without watching videos, it can go up to 10 hours. If WIFI is OFF and you are doing just basic office tasks, it can go up to 11 hours.

Im currently in Asia and I wanted a new laptop. Since Im a die-hard fan of Chromebooks my choice was easy; the new Samsung Chromebook Plus for its size, weight, performance and battery life. I currently own 3 other Chromebooks and absolutely LOVE them all! I want to start off by saying how INCREDIBLY AMAZING Amazon is when it comes to customer service. When I ordered the laptop Amazon shipped it directly to me in Thailand. When it arrived, the Samsung Chromebook case was defective through no fault of Amazon. I called Amazon and asked what to do; an Amazon representative told me to ship it back to them and once they receive it they would send me out a brand new replacement unit and credit me back for the shipping BOTH ways! If anyone ever has ANY doubts about buying from any company other than Amazon in a feeble attempt to possibly save a couple dollars DO NOT DO IT! There is not a retailer on planet earth who backs up their products like anyone else...believe me, I get paid lots of money to work with some of the largest electronics corporations in the world to streamline their customer service and customer retention departments...Amazon is head and shoulders above them all!PROS:Size and weight...as I said, I travel a LOT and having a lightweight, thin laptop is imperative for me. This Chromebook weighs less than 2.5 lbs and easily slips into a backpack, brief case or carry-on bag with ease.Battery: As good as any I have tested and used; approximately 10 hours watching videos with the screen brightness at about 50%. I can watch numerous movies in High Def on overseas flights without worry of my battery dying. It charges in around 2 hours from a completely dead battery.Display: Wonderful, clean, crisp and easy on the eyes. This screen is equally impressive regardless of what Im watching; a High-Def movie, a YouTube video or typing a report. Resolution is fantastic, colors are vibrant, accurate and true to life, tremendous detail, sharp blacks and white colors...typical Samsung high-end screen quality! Theres a reason Samsung will be supplying Apple it's OLED screens for the new iPhone 8.Touch Screen: Once again, its typical Samsung ingenuity; precise and balanced. All gestures work perfectly and the screen is ultra responsive.Pen: I honestly did not care much about the pen when I bought it and assumed I would only use it once or twice a year at most. The pen has turned into quite a nice feature for me to capture parts of the screen image, for notes, drawing circles around certain parts of messages, web sites etc. I now am hooked on it and wonder just how I lived without it?Fit and Finish: Like all Samsung products, their design is in a word sexy...nice lines, curves and subtle details where needed, not overstated but more functional and aesthetically pleasing in IMO. The keyboard works perfectly fine for me...the keys feel solid and the trackpad is precise. I would have preferred a back-lit keypad but for the price and functionality Im MORE than satisfied with this Chromebook. The only nit-picky thing I would like to have changed is the accessibility of the Micro-SD card slot. Its somewhat under the side on the base and I personally find it not real user-friendly. Again, thats just my personal preference...your milage may vary.Speed and Performance: This is as fast as any Chromebook I have never tested or used. I generally have 10-15 tabs open simultaneously and it never bogs down. Every computer in the world may experience a hiccup on occasion, even $2,000 ones but this has been rock solid, super smooth and I personally have not experienced one speed-bump while using it. I cant honestly imagine why anyone would opt for the Pro version of this Chromebook???CONS:Ports: The only reason I deducted one star is because of the USB-C ports. Sure I knew that before I bought it but having now lived with it for over a month I find the USB-C ports a big headache. In time Im sure most of the big guys like Logitech etc. will come out with mice and keyboards with USB-C adaptors already part of their ecosystem but until they do I personally find it extremely frustrating having to use multiple adaptors to expand and personalize my Chromebook. I ended up buying several adaptors to set up my new Samsung Chromebook. I use an HDMI cable connected to a 24 flat screen monitor as well as a wireless mouse (USB adaptor) and wired USB keyboard. I find the adaptors bulky, cumbersome and quite frankly the HDMI just does not work efficiently. It casts the screen properly to my monitor but when I open up anything from the Google Play store the screen flickers horrifically and is rendered useless! I have tried multiple adaptors from various manufacturers and they all to the exact same thing. I cant use any Play Store apps at all when the monitor is plugged in. Im sure its a Google compatibility issue with the Play Store apps that I hope will eventually iron itself out over time. For now, until more accessory manufacturers start making USB-C accessories that I can plug directly into my USB-C port I find it a real nuisance to have expensive, unnattractive dongles hanging out of my gorgeous sleek laptop.Other than the port issue this Chromebook is an absolute MUST buy! Its super fast, clean, sexy, lightweight, incredible battery life and the touchscreen is phenomenal! With the built in pen whats not to love!",2,4,5,4,5
495,"This product IS NOT as described in the posting. This laptop computer does not have a ""backlit keyboard"" as described. I received the computer and did not realize until I had already completed the initial computer setup. It would be a bigger burden for me to return the computer to factory settings, repackage the item, submit for return, have it shipped back, and wait for my money back than it would be for me to just continue using it with my discontent.",3,2,1,2,2
496,"I was looking for something lightweight and fast. This is both of those. Going from a Windows OS to the Chrome OS was something I wasn't sure about. I've always used Windows, but I bought my 81 year old mom a Chromebook for Christmas, and she loves it. I figured if she can figure it out, I can too. Setup is simple and straightforward, just log into your Google account, if you have one. If not, you can create one.. I bought a flash drive for pics and files. I added my VPN, that setup was simple too. The price can't be beat, the screen looks awesome and text size can be modified. I'd definitely recommend this",2,2,5,4,2
497,I think this is a pretty good computer for the price. It is good for basic functions like browsing the internet or if you just want to use Windows or Word to write with. It has a DVD/CD drive also. Good computer for the price for basic use. Battery does not last too long.,2,1,2,4,2
498,"So the RAM is DDR2 and is only 4GB for ever. So the internal drive is 32G, 16 usable after OS is installed. So the SD Card does stick out, it works well, it just sticks out so you must unmount and remove before packing your laptop away. The screen is fine, it is functional, it is fine. The keyboard, while not back-lit, works well. Not too much play. The QC on the laptop was good. The laptop is very light and quiet.This is not a speed demon, this can get laggy if too many resources are being used. It is perfect for web-surfing, it handles MS Office well. I haven't tried any hardcore data processing, but that's not what this laptop is. This is not a gaming machine, you could try, but I'm sure most games would not run well.So far, it's been a great laptop. I purchased knowing that a sub $200 laptop is not optimal, but it meets my needs. I store my documents online, I access most work apps online, and it is insanely light. Again, it runs Office apps, including Access and Outlook fine.I highly recommend for light tasks and not gaming. It would be great for most students, and frankly, most people using the web and running MS Office applications.",3,4,5,4,3

As to specs, I can't necessarily comment because as long as it works, I'm good.:) I use this for business so was looking for the best value with most capacity, etc. I'm not a gamer.

506,I bought two of these chromebooks for Christmas present our two teen kids. Both products arrived dirty with many stains on the cover and highly scratched keyboard surface. I spent hours trying unsuccessfully to clean both products. The advertising listing and picture suggested it was silver metal surface but it was a white plastic coating that has many reports of stains. The notebook function and screen are fine so far but we had to spend $20 each on a new cover. Requested help from seller but only obtained an automatic response. After days of no response to our questions and concerns we were forced to get the covers.,2,2,5,4,3

I have used the laptop almost 1 week, so far every things works normal and smooth, the experience while using the laptop is great. I use it for a little gaming, internet, and typing this comment in Amazon.

An S-pen is a huge asset for anybody working outside an office, especially somebody that needs to produce usable maps, markup photos and screenshots to attach to contracts, and similar uses. I was excited to see a hybrid device that would accelerate my workflow.Over the last several months, I continue to be disappointed, even after updates. The pen that is integrated to this device is capable enough, but I have found the device itself wanting. Rotating the device and using websites like ISSUU - no-brainer uses for a laptop-cum-tablet - inevitably causes the device to crash. Worse, it becomes nonresponsive to the power button, and even closing the screen, then unfolding it again, fails to fix the problem.My verdict: close, but not there yet. If you really want this device, you should look at the Pro version over the Plus and read the reviews carefully to compare against your individual use case.",2,4,5,4,5

(why?). My other Chromebook (Acer) died that I bought in 2016. I've been using an older Acer Chromebook I bought many yrs ago, small but has never given me a problem. Bought this one to use while waiting for a new hard drive on my newer Acer (bought in 2016)that's always been unstable and just died.So far this one seems nice.. i will update my review as time goes on since i just received it today. I haven't tried the speakers or the battery life yet.. I'll update this in a month or so after i see how everything works out, but for a refurbished product, right out of the box, i'm satisfied so far.Next day: This refurbished chromebook is supposed to have at least 7 hrs battery life. i""m happy to say I used it 9.5 hrs unplugged and the meter said I had almost 4 hours left of battery use. We'll see how that works out in the months to come.1/24 Battery continues to have long life but the meter is very irregular. One minute it says i have 7 hrs and 30 mins left, an hour later it says i have 10 hrs and 40 mins left, an hour later it says I have 8 hrs and 20 mins left - either way, so far, it is long (enough) battery life.*I'm not really happy with the lack of depth of color on this chromebook - it's supposed to be non-glare and that may be contributing to the issue i have with the lack of color.. there is no enhancer (1 app avail and does nothing) and these chromebooks have no settings for color.. this particular book, the color doesn't pop, has no depth.. very disappointing compared to my other 2 chromebooks.* Speakers are just ok - nothing to write home about but they do the basic job.

Trust me, it works really fast. In fact, I can't tell the difference between my old laptop and this. I was actually contemplating getting a macbookFor someone contemplating purchasing a MacBook, get this. It does everything that an ideal MacBook owner does brilliantly. Check email, streaming HD content, Spotify, ITunes etc is just as fast as a MacBook 12 inch. It has a quad core processor compared to the Intel M chip in the MacBook. Both can't do video editing, both have a 480p camera and for 20 bucks, you can get a 64 gig microsd card, making the storage capacity the same.The battery life is absolutely spectacular. For someone like me doing the regulars like web browsing, movie watching and document processing, it has failed to give a battery life less than 11 hours. It also has a good standby time. I mean leave it on sleep for a night and the battery hardly drops more than 2 percent with wifi running in the background.The icing on the cake is the free office with 1TB cloud support for a year. I mean office 365 for 5 devices retails at 90 bucks a year and office for a single pc costs 150 bucks. I mean literally use this for a year, throw it and get a new one with office support. That way you'll always keep upgrading your processor and ram.With 8 tabs open, Spotify running in the background, and word open, it hasn't slowed down. The 4gigs of ram helps.The only downside is that windows updates reduce the onboard storage quite a bit. To get rid of that issue, go to storage and delete the older windows version everytime you update. It automatically deletes it in 30 days anyways.Do yourself a favor and save some money",3,1,5,4,3
591,"I ordered this because in the past, Lenovo has been an excellent computer manufacturer. When I opened the box, the computer was very sleek and nicely designed. It was the size I needed and the keyboard was very ergonomic. The problems started when I initially powered up the device. It began making a rattling noise like a pin on a record player nonstop. I looked through forums and saw the same issue. I went to Lenovo support and they said is was a common issue and that they were changing the HDD in them. The computer was also terrible laggy- I couldn't browse multiple tabs, the screen kept refreshing, etc. For the price, this computer is loaded with bloatware and unacceptably slow. It is a complete waste of money- Buyer Beware, it is not even good for light home use.",3,2,1,4,2

And then constant reminders to change my passwords even though I already have. In one of these frustrating moments, I happened to wander into a Microsoft store and landed in front of the new Surface laptop. I was pretty blown away. Great looking machine; very comfortable to use, and FAST. After hemming and hawing, I bought one - the basic $799 i5 model w/ 4 GB RAM and 128 SSD. I am beyond thrilled.

Again, wifi only connects to some routers, then a few days after receiving, the touchpad completely dies and tech support suggests sending it in as none of their suggestions worked. On top of this, the laptop would sometimes freeze up completely even when nothing was open and very little ram/cpu/memory was being used, forcing me to hard-restart it. I ended up having to buy a cheap external wifi (which connects to all routers, this means the wifi card in these laptops is faulty), a usb to update windows 10 since it lacks any reasonable memory, and now since the touchpad died, I'll have to buy a mouse. I'm returning this and NEVER buying Acer again.Garbage laptops, stay away.",3,4,5,4,3
609,"Its probably best to start by clarifying what this laptop isnt. It's not a desktop replacement even for an office environment. The 32GB hard drive just isnt enough to operate at the core of your workflow, even if your workflow is mostly spreadsheets. Its not a premiere media consumption device, the screen isnt good enough and the speakers leave much to be desired. It certainly wont be able to handle any gaming outside a very limited sphere of low spec games, even then I wouldnt recommend it. With all that out of the way, what does the Aspire One do a good job at? It can handle office tasks, web browsing, and media consumption.The build quality of the laptop is great for the price point. The keyboard is good and the trackpad is okay. The only major letdown of the actual construction are the enormous bezels around the screen. In 2017, theyre almost comically large. The screen is also a letdown with terrible viewing angles and colors so off its difficult to tell youve found the right viewing angle even when you try. I understand the prestige the engineers were going for when they offered a full 1080p display on a laptop at this price point, but I would have gladly sacrificed the screen resolution for better colors. One of the only redeeming factors of the screen is its brightness, allowing for usage outside on a clear day, if youre willing to squint just a bit. The webcam isnt much better, offering just enough definition so that you can safely identify who youre talking to. The microphone is grainy and cant handle even a slight breeze, though it does compensate for changes in volume very well.When it comes to raw performance the laptop is surprisingly good. Due to the SSD, the boot time is excellent and the tasks it can run with its limited memory are always snappy. The WIFI card is good enough for taking advantage of 30 Mbps plus internet speeds and the Bluetooth pairs quickly. By far the biggest bottleneck with this device is the limited memory. Even when youre being conscious of your activity, running no more than two office applications at once, be prepared to encounter at least one warning a day from windows about your RAM limitations.PROS:Good ProcessorFast Hard DriveGreat Boot TimeExcellent Battery LifeFull Version of WindowsNo BloatwareCONS:Poor ScreenLimited RamLackluster TrackpadBad SpeakersNoisy WebcamA student might reasonably ask, can I get by on just this laptop? The short answer is yes, but thats a bit risky. Even if your major isnt film production and you dont need to edit 4k footage on a daily basis, I still wouldnt recommend it. If you chose to make this laptop the core of your workflow you will be forced to kiss any serious multitasking goodbye, along with large amounts of local storage. Youll end up keeping close tabs on your files, pushing a lot of them to an external drive or cloud storage. It would be a good idea to pair the laptop with even an entry level desktop or just find a way to get a higher end device. With that said, if you only have two hundred dollars, go for it. Itll handle all your office tasks.Buying budget products today is filled with uncertainty. Even when an item has the specs to do what you want, theres always a lingering anxiety that the day may come when you need it to perform and it will let you done. This is especially true for something like a laptop, the center of the mobile workplace. Despite its price, the Acer Aspire One doesnt disappoint, it handles office tasks well and operates okay as a media consumption device. What more can you ask for the price?",3,4,5,4,3

614,"I have never written a review before, but I am shocked to see all the extremely good reviews for this product. I had only had the laptop for about 2 days when it began having a problem. When i opened the laptop from sleep mode it was backlit but black. I tried many different ways to wake it up, turn it off, and let the battery die. The problem persisted for a while until I finally was able to bring up the login screen and shut it down not using the power button, but the on screen button. Further, the track pad has the common pinch and zoom capability but constantly zooms in and out when I am just moving the cursor. But the lag on the track pad is also a issue because then I try and correct the zoom but because of the 4 or 5 second lag it ends up overcompensating the other way. As well, the scrolling function of the track pad is horrible. It either jumps 10 pages or moves incredibly slowly. Applications take ages to open and I have not added a single one on here nor anything other than what came on the laptop, so it will only get slower from here. I am absolutely returning. I had the $150 samsung chromebook before this but needed excel. However, that chromebook was far superior to this.",3,1,5,4,3

618,"This laptop didn't have many reviews, but I took a chance because I believed Dell to be of good quality based on reputation. Everything about it sounded great. Nice size, weight, resolution, battery life, number of ports, etc. All fantastic on paper.Then it arrived.I was excited to have a 2-in-1, so I immediately started using it in tablet mode, and I was greatly enjoying it. It all seemed like it was going to be fantastic. But then I decided to start testing it out in laptop mode and doing some browsing and reading, and let me tell you that this has the worst touch pad I have ever had the displeasure of using. Ever.If you are familiar with modern laptops, then you know the usual features. You use two fingers together and run them up and down to scroll. You spread two fingers away from each other to zoom out and pinch them together to zoom in. When these features work independently of each other, it all works great.However, that is not so with this piece of trash.The problem is that the touch pad is incapable of consistently differentiating between the two touches. For instance, imagine that you want to read a PDF at 100% zoom. You would imagine that that you could simply run your index and middle fingertips vertically across the touch pad, and then everything will scroll accordingly while maintaining 100% zoom. Not with this laptop. It constantly ends up thinking that the movement of your two fingers is a command to zoom, rather than a command to scroll. No matter how close I keep my two fingertips together, it inevitably ends up mixing in a zoom in/out command when all I want to do is scroll up/down. It doesn't matter how much or in what way I adjust the sensitivity -- it keeps on zooming when I am just trying to scroll.If you are in tablet mode, it's great. If you are using an external mouse, it's great. But if you want to use the touch pad, then forget about it. This is a completely useless product due to the laziness and lack of quality control that went into programming the touch pad. In 2018, this is absolutely unacceptable.How can the designers of this product have the gall to sell it with this atrocious touch pad? Are you people really so shameless?Dell has really fallen off the wagon, and I will never buy another Dell product ever again, nor will I ever recommend Dell to anyone ever again.

624,"I rolled the dice on this laptop when I was looking for a lightweight, small laptop for grad school and I don't regret it. It's surprisingly hard to find an 11 inch laptop that's not some app-dependent, hybrid tablet (which was totally NOT what I was looking for), so this was perfect. It's important to keep perspective here: This isn't a high-powered machine. What it is, is a no-frills, basic laptop for standard, every day use (emails, word processing, surfing the web). For those modest purposes, it's more than fast enough and the hard drive is more than enough if you're just saving papers, pdf's, recipes, school stuff, etc. Just to be safe, I doubled the storage with a mini SD card for cheap. So far, I'm most impressed with the laptop's battery life. I feel most companies exaggerate their devices battery life, but I really am getting 10-11 hours out of each charge. If you don't want to spend a lot of money for a decent computer, this is a great system. If you're doing graphic design, playing games, or recording/editing music (like I do on another laptop), look elsewhere. This laptop cost less than my textbooks and it's exceeded my expectations.

All I wanted was a nice little computer to surf the internet and read a few e-books. I didn't really put much at all on this no games! I don't even understand why we are told we getting any real disk space. I ordered this on Nov 30th. At least my other Acer computers lasted a few years before this started happening.

643,"***Edit: the first review that you are reading was posted shortly after receving the product. The second one is taken two months later, and I recommend you follow the recent review in comparison. Originally rated 4 stars, now 3.***This the ASUS VivoBook Flip 14 m3-7Y30.Ok, let's start out with the minor faults I have found:For the 14 inch m3, there is no backlit keyboard, no finger sensor, and you are not sent the pen. I feel like Amazon made this very misleading and I find that to be very unfortunate. There are a few different version of this laptop, but I think it's best to differentiate which laptop has these certain perks, and to not advertise like it has all of them. I was really looking forward to the backlit keyboard but like I said, it doesn't come on this one.But aside from that, I am so far really enjoying this laptop. It's really beautiful, thin, and light, and I know this will perfectly fit in my backpack without straining my shoulders. The screen is a great size for watching TV shows, movies, and any YouTube video, and I think that will come in really handy. Asus did a superior job with making the bezels much thinner, and it really shows. Ontop of that, the audio is stellar, and I am blown away at the power of the sound that this little thing has! The bass can be heard extremely well, and the speakers on both the left and right sides are rich and full. I've never heard better audio on any laptop before. Finally, the laptop seems to run quite smooth and quick, even when I've got about six or seven tabs open when doing schoolwork. Starting up does not take long either. In terms of the glare, I honestly don't think it's terrible, but if you focus on it, of course it will be noticeable. I don't think it's that bad, and I still think the images appear nicely. Yes, 100% brightness on this type of laptop may not be as bright on either a Mac or even a Samsung Chromebook, but I don't mind since my eyes strain easily from a screen that is too bright. That being said though, viewing in intensely sunny places may not be the best idea. The keyboard types nicely and the touch pad is very smooth. One thing I noticed about Asus laptops from YouTube reviews is that the keyboard is very bouncy, but it is rather firm on here and there is no bounce at all. Touch screen works fine, but lags occasionally here and there. I don't know if it's because it's new, but even when using the touch screen, the screen is still very clean. I'd finally like to add that it is a very silent laptop, and it did heat up while charging, but after removing it, it was fine. Speaking of the charger, it's very convenient since it's small and compact.Overall this is quite the fine laptop for the price, and it's certainly a looker. I only wish that Asus would make laptops that have all of this plus the backlit keyboard in the same price range. I will update my review after a few months or if I find anything wrong with the laptop. For now I recommend this for any student who wants a laptop that can be used for school and entertainment. Also, this is one of the nicest looking laptops out there for a great price. Excited to see what else Asus has to offer, and I really hope they can continue expanding!***2 Months Later*** - 1 Star due to underperforming battery life and pad lagging. The main perk of this laptop is how easily you can move with it. It's light and compact, and that's a huge must for me as a college student walking along campus. The performance hasn't lagged, but I do have issues with the the touch pad (the thing you use for the mouse? Not the screen) being slow and randomly spazing out. Also the dark glare has become bothersome but can I really complain that much? I'm still bothered that Amazon hasn't fixed the description of this product, because I still long for the back lit keyboard when it gets dark, but again, it's a very minor thing that shouldn't drop a star from the door star rating. If there's one thing that should is the battery life. I'm kind of getting tired of technology telling us about this great battery life we're getting, when after doing actual work, we really aren't. Of course I have many tabs open when I work and I will watch YouTube or listen to Spotify, but I still feel like the life could be a lot better than what was advertised. I am pretty sure that I am not the only student who has various tabs/programs open. Concerning the 360 ability of the laptop... I really don't use it. Just to show people ""hey look!"" and that's it. If they charge more for that, that's really ridiculous. I don't use the touch screen too much since I'm not a fan of dirtying my screen, but I suppose it can be helpful when the pad lags. I will say that a good thing about this laptop is that it doesn't take long at all to turn on and the speakers. I'm still highly impressed by these speakers. But with that being said, I'm not sure if I'm going to buy another Asus laptop after this. If you're on a budget I recommend getting this for now, but if you can splurge on something pricier that has better performance then go ahead. It's crazy to say that $600 isn't a lot for a laptop, because if you ask me, that's barely how much I make in a month working part time while going to school full time... While technology has graced us, it has also burdoned us with high costs for an ultimately subpar performance. Unfortunately what can we do? It's a practical necessity as a student to have a stable computer that does x y and z. Nevertheless, I still hope that Asus will continue to improve their products. For now, this is an aesthetically pleasing and compact laptop that performs at a slightly above average performance with some cons that greatly bring it down.",2,2,5,4,3

659,"I run a small family business from home, and without a laptop, I'm dead in the water. My Toshiba has been slowly dying for the last few weeks, and is now on it's last leg. Great computer, but I needed another one, and fast. Boss just purchased a new laptop herself and suggested the Dell Inspiron. She said she ""loves it"".Dell Inspiron purchased, with expedited shipping. I was thrilled to receive it before 10am just two days after ordering. During setup, I noticed something I've never seen: extremely loud beeps (enough to get the entire household to ask what was going on), accompanied by error codes. All codes stated there is no hard drive. WTH???? It then popped up with a QR Code to scan, which took me to Dell's website. Yep. Dell themselves backed it up. ""No hard drive"". They were nice enough to offer to ship an external hard drive to me, free of any charges. That doesn't work on my end. Ever spend a lot of time on the road? Traveling with extra gear really bogs you down, and if they were sending me one to install myself that wouldn't be external? Yeah no.End result: Have spoken to Staples. Taking my old, kind of still working, laptop in this afternoon, buying another one, and calling the seller of the hunk of plastic that arrived today to come pick it up and give me a full refund.

Also although the laptop seems speedy clicking around in windows and opening some basic apps (calculator, ip scanner, etc.) as soon as I open chrome and load a youtube page the things slows to a crawl, scrolling is super choppy, etc. It is not just youtube either, it seems to be anything that is graphics heavy like cnn or fox, theverge.com, vimeo, etc. Not sure if this is due to the ""hard drive errors"" or is indicative of general performance.

670,"### Updated Sep. 1, 2017 ###The latest Chrome OS update has corrected the fullscreen app persistence issue. Thank you Google & Samsung! Android apps now remember their previous state and will launch or restore from lock in fullscreen mode if they were previously running fullscreen. That's one major annoyance down.Moreover, the entire Android subsystem appears to have received a major overhaul with this latest version. Not only does fullscreen mode persist, apps no longer have to restart after unlocking the device. App stability seems to have been largely unaffected, at least based on the small sample size I have installed. Now if they would just fix the video stutter and allow us to disable that cursed lock button!### Original review follows ###I've been using the Chromebook Plus every day for the past three months and decided that I had given it enough time to ""grow"" on me as much as it was going to. My use case may not be typical so please consider it when making your purchase decision. I travel a lot and as a result, many of my opinions are based on how good the user experience is in the context of sitting on flights and in airports. Before I go into detail, the TL;DR version is that for someone like myself, it's good not great and has some major annoyances.The Good- Display is colorful, defect free, with very little backlight bleed and the 3:2 aspect ratio is perfect for a hybrid device such as this.- Hinges are sturdy and will hold the display at any angle, in both tablet and laptop position, even through considerable turbulence.- Basic productivity tasks such as web browsing and document editing (via Google Docs) work well.- Overall performance is better than expected, excepting a specific issue I'll cover below.- Expandable storage via MicroSD is welcome, though some workarounds are necessary for managing the Android file system.- Android app compatibility is better than expected, with some annoyances I'll get into in a bit.- Touch and stylus input works well (though I rarely use it).- Trackpad tracks well and has the basic multi-touch features you'd expect. There are even a few configurable options to dial it into your personal preference.The In-between- Keyboard is just okay. Nothing special but perfectly functional, though a bit mushy.- Battery life is less than advertised under what I consider normal use. Not horrible; not great.- Wi-fi radio hasn't been problematic. No random connection drops but 5GHz range is lacking, even by 5GHz standards.The Bad- Display isn't bright enough for outdoor use without an anti-glare screen ""protector"". Dark scenes in Movie/TV media will lose considerable detail in bright environments.- Audio volume isn't loud enough for noisy environments such as an airplane, even with active noise cancelling headphones. Granted, raising the volume to maximum will mostly suffice but I find myself straining to hear dialog far too often.- No audio configuration at all. Not even a basic EQ, which would have helped offset the volume issues.- Build quality is sub-par. The bottom panel will eventually (if not immediately out of the box) start to creak with a little pressure and tightening the screws doesn't help. The ""aluminum"" finish easily scratches, which is not surprising considering that it's just painted plastic.- Clicking the trackpad requires more pressure than it should and is quite problematic at its edges. After 3 months of constant use, it's loosened up some, but not enough.The Ugly- Video playback will stutter badly for a few seconds every 20-30(ish) minutes during playback regardless of the source with seemingly no attributable cause. Even locally stored media exhibits this behavior, ruling out connectivity issues.- USB MIDI does not work; at all! This has been confirmed by Samsung and is a big issue for those who would use it.- The physical lock button on the side of the device causes the device to lock instantaneously and requires reentry of user credentials when unlocking. The only way around this is to not require credentials to unlock; a real no-no for travelers (more on this in the next section).- The ""Full Screen Immersive"" button lives on the keyboard, and as such must be disabled when in tablet position (more on this in the next section).The UX NightmareThis is a compound issue revolving around the physical lock button and full screen key. In fact, there are multiple issues here that are better conveyed through a use case so here goes...As mentioned previously, if your device is configured to require credentials upon unlocking (as well it should be), accidentally touching the lock button, perhaps to the armrest on an airline seat, means reentering your password every single time it happens. If a configuration option that is common to most mobile devices, such as a timed delay before credentials are required was available, this issue would be more tolerable. Even a delay of a few seconds would allow you to ""undo"", much like a Windows PC will allow you to ""wiggle"" the mouse as soon as the display goes black without actually going into full lock-down.Couple this with the fact that once you lock the device and subsequently unlock it, any app that was in fullscreen mode is now back in ""windowed"" mode (for lack of a better term). Why is this so annoying? So here's my user story; I start up Netflix to watch a movie as I'm settling in for my 4 hour flight. I use the fullscreen key while in laptop position (because that's the only time you can) then flip the display over into tablet position only to accidentally touch the lock button either with my hand or against the armrest (both easy to do on a plane in cramped quarters). Bam! Now I have to flip the display back over, type in my password, press the fullscreen key again, flip back into tablet position, etc. Frustrating!Two simple tweaks would solve everything. First, allow the user to disable the physical lock button! It's not necessary as the device can be locked from the UI. Second, persist the fullscreen state of apps. This level of UX frustration shouldn't exist on a device built by Samsung and running a Google OS.The Bottom LineThe Chromebook Plus is a good but not great device that unfortunately, has very little competition. Release channel Android compatibility is a must for myself and many other users which severely limits our options. I've been holding out hope that some of the easily correctable issues would have been addressed by now but sadly, they have not. As a result, I now consider my Chromebook Plus to be an interim solution until a better option comes along. With that in mind, it's not a bad device for the asking price but I would gladly pay more for something better.",2,4,5,4,5
671,"If you're looking for a Macbook alternative, the Surface line is the go to option. This laptop has incredible build quality and feels like a tank.

It will connect for a minute and disconnect but it will show that it's still connected to my wifi. I bought an Ethernet cable but I don't want an Ethernet cable to my laptop. I should've just got a desktop computer I guess. The point of a laptop is to take it around with you, not sitting on your desk hooked to an Ethernet cable because it can't connect to WiFi. I've had this laptop for about two weeks and I've only used it once because it was hooked to an Ethernet cable. Other times I've tried it without the Ethernet cable and it doesn't work.

677,"I used to wonder why anyone would need to spend more than $200 on a laptop (or $139 for the fully functional laptop that I got at a Thanksgiving day sale a couple of years ago). And I still think that, if you are on a very tight budget, that is the way to go. But if you can afford it, these gaming laptops really do give you better performance and better experience. It is not always that you get a faster CPU (although the CPU may have improved functionality that is not always revealed by the clock speed), sometimes you are also getting significantly better graphics and sound cards/chips or more cached memory. And this Acer Nitro laptop does have all that with a really beautiful screen all packaged up in a sleek case.We are not using this machine for gaming (although I ran a few gaming benchmark tests like Heaven and was impressed at the brilliant graphics and speed and heat management) but the improved performance, like fast screen updating, works just fine for non-gaming users.You get NO HARD DISK but you do get 256 gigs of SSD and that certainly performs faster than a hard disk. I have to say that I still like my computers to come with a hard disk and Acer will provide you with the necessary hardware to insert your own disk drive. For now, I have no desire to open up and look inside this machine - instead I salvaged a fairly new 2-terabyte Firecuda sata drive from a desktop that I retired - stuck the drive in an external USB 3.0 drive enclosure. My external drive works just fine - I cannot boot from it but why would I want to when I can boot from the SSD. If you want your laptop to be really portable, you will probably want to use an internal drive rather than an external one.",2,0,3,2,2

699,"Bought this laptop to run Manjaro KDE (Linux) and act as my primary ""everyday use"" computer at home. Ill break the review down into 2 parts. Ill start first with the hardware which should be helpful to anyone reading this and then the second part will specifically be about using Linux on it. Model is Dell i5379-5893GRY-PUS (Dell Inspiron 13"" 2-in-1 touchscreen)Hardware:The build quality is nice. Despite being a plastic shell (instead of metal like the Inspiron 7000) it feels of good quality to the point of questioning if it is plastic. The finish is nice and doesn't appear to attract finger prints as much as glossier finishes. Its a good balance of enough weight to not feel cheap but not too much that its ""heavy"" for its size.Specs:* Intel i5-8250U (8th gen i5 with 4c/8t @ 15watt TDP)* Intel UHD Graphics 620 (integrated graphics, no dedicated GPU)* 8GB DDR4 2400mhz RAM (I think 1x8GB, will have to verify)* 256GB SATA SSD (Samsung PM871 from what I can tell, seems to be 2.5"" 7mm not m.2)* 13"" 1920x1080 IPS touchscreen (glossy, but not terrible)* Webcam supports Windows HelloPorts:2x USB 3.1 type-A1x USB 2.0 type-A1x HDMI (listed as 1.4)1x SD card reader1x Headphone/mic combo jackThe monitor has, in my opinion, pretty large bezels. At first I was disappointed by this but considering its ability to take a tablet form, this likely was done to give something to hold onto in tablet mode without touching the screen by accident. Otherwise its sharp and bright with decent viewing angles.The rear of the base has a short, somewhat wide vent to exhaust hot air out and does have an active fan however at its loudest it was negligible. I would have to focus on trying to hear it to notice. The upside is it should allow longer boost times on the CPU before throttling sets in.I found it a bit strange at first that the power and volume rocker are on the right side towards the front of the machine, but have since gotten used to it and figure it is also likely purposeful due to being able to use it like a tablet.The hinge between the base and monitor is sturdy and feels like it should last if treated well. I dont notice any wobbling while typing on a hard flat surface. The keyboard is ok but not great. I like the look of it and the backlighting can be plenty bright but the feel leaves a bit to be desired. The key presses seem to allow for pressure un-evenly on a key allowing one side to press further than the others which gives the sense that its not that sturdy. I would expect for the press to evenly push the key down but on this keyboard its a bit ""mushy"". For what its worth it appears to be the exact same keyboard as the Inspiron 13"" 7000 series. On the flip side, the touch pad is pretty nice and I typically hate touchpads. This one is pretty large and the buttons (bottom right and left of the touchpad itself) are clicky.It doesnt look like there are any bay doors on the bottom to access the SSD or RAM and the batter is a built in job, not easily replaceable (if at all). It is unclear if the laptop has the 8GB included soldered in or in 1 of 2 ram slots. Its also unclear, but I expect that there is an empty 2nd ram slot (as most documentation seems to indicate it can be upgraded to 16GB by the user, just not how). I would imagine this would require removing the 8 or so screws on the bottom and maybe even using a pry tool to unsnap some plastic fasteners are the edges.For the price I was unable to find a laptop with everything I was looking to compete with this. I wanted a 13"" or smaller 1080 touchscreen with an 8th gen CPU, 250GB+ SSD, 8GB+ DDR4 RAM. This was the best deal I could find at the time including that ($709). There are tradeoffs with that. Some of what you dont get are:* USB type-c* Thunderbolt 3* NVMe PCIe SSD* Metal body* Higher resolution screenI would say this is a great machine for anyone who wants something small and portable with decent specs and that doesnt require a ton of storage or super demanding tasks (CAD, 3d rendering, advanced photoshop, extrmely large databases/spreadsheets, etc.) or gaming.Linux:I am now using Linux at work alot and learn best by giving myself a practical purpose to do something. I wanted to entrench myself in Linux at home while having something that was modern, aesthetically pleasing, functional, practical and portable.Prior to getting this laptop I tried about about 10+ distros and decided that; a) I liked KDE Plasma as a desktop environment best and b) I like Manjaro Linux as a distro the most.I didnt get this to do development type work from or anything like that. This is meant to be my ""daily driver"", its what I will use every day to browse the web, check email, work on documents, watch media, do some minor photo/video editing, occasionally run a VM, etc.I downloaded the 17.0.6 Manjaro KDE ISO and setup an USB3 drive to install from. Booted from the drive and ran installer which took about 5-10 mins which is on par or maybe slightly faster than I would expect for a Win 10 install using the same hardware/specs.Out of the box all of the drivers where recognized and working. Here are a couple things I was worried about and can confirm all working:* Qualcomm AC Wifi (will add model later, not handy right now).* Qualcomm Bluetooth* Touchscreen* Keyboard Backlight* Webcam (both standard and infrared lol)* GPU drivers for Intel* Screen Brightness* SoundI have not yet found any part of the hardware not working as intended.Battery life appears to land me at about 6+ hours of steady use so I am very happy with it.Software wise, most things just work. I have had to, as with any linux distro, troubleshoot and work out some kinks but nothing I can even recall as worth mentioning.At the end of the day, this is the first time I have felt like I really own the computer. KDE especially allows a level of customization I could only dream of in Windows. This is coming from someone who not only likes Windows 10, but previously worked for a company for 6 years with MS partnership in which we provided remote and on site support for many of their products including Windows and Office. I've developed professional course material and classes on Windows and taught the classes. I have defended Windows 10 fiercely at times. I have Windows Server 2016 Essentials at home and 3 other Windows 10 Pro computers on the domain with it.Why say all this about Windows? If someone like me can escape MS's strangle hold so can you. If you have considered moving to Linux this laptop is a great choice. However, dont take my word for it. Do your research, decide what distro and make sure it will work with whatever you install it on.EDIT (11/20/2017): So it appears the RAM and SSD can be upgraded. To do so requires removing the bottom of the laptop (roughly 8-10 screws and using a pry tool to unhinge the plastic tabs). Crucial shows upto 32GB (2x 16GB) RAM and guarantees compatibility. The SSD is a 2.5"" SATA SSD 7mm height, so m.2 drives will NOT work and especially not PCIe/NVMe drives. I havent upgraded myself as I have no need to now.EDIT (01/02/2018): For anyone concerned with firmware/BIOS updates while using Linux I have done a Intel ME Firmware update and a BIOS update (1.3.2).For the Intel SA-00086 advisory and update Dell has a page listing all model affected with links to their updates (a link to it is posted on Intel's official page for the advisory). In this case I used a Windows to Go drive to boot to Windows 10 without altering the installed setup on my machine. I had to install drivers to Intels ME and reboot. I then ran the update from Windows to Go and then shutdown and booted back to Manjaro KDE to verify the results via the script Intel provides and it returned that the issue was patched. Be aware booting from Windows to Go wouldnt be needed if running Windows already.The BIOS is actually easier. You just put the BIOS update exe on a thumb drive and plug it in, boot and press F12 to get the boot menu, select BIOS update. Browse to the update file on the thumb drive and run the update. I havent seen any other firmware udpates related to the laptop but if there are others I will likely use a Windows to go drive to do so unless its specifically a BIOS update.**Upgraded machine!!!I have since purchase changed the wifi card and upgraded the RAM. I did this as the QCA6174 wifi card made by Qualcomm isnt exactly Linux friendly. It worked, but had 2 major issues. Slow SMB xfer and it would report wifi connecting at 6 MiB/s (incorrectly). I bought an Intel 8265 which is officially supported for use in Linux brand new for $20 and works perfectly.I figured while I had it open to add another stick of RAM so I bought an 8GB stick of crucial RAMCrucial 8GB Single DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) DR x8 Unbuffered SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT8G4SFD824Aand it worked perfectly. To be honest the RAM upgrade wasnt even needed, but didnt want to break it open just to change the wifi card out. I considered an SSD upgrade as well, but I have like 200GB free of the 256GB so I am not exactly hurting for space.Also using this bluetooth mouseLogitech MX Anywhere 2 Wireless Mobile Mouse, Long Range Wireless Mouse with Hyper Scroll and Easy-Switch up to 3 Devices - Navywhich plays very nicely connected via bluetooth.

I'm a cheapskate so that's saying a lot.Being a student, I was a little worried that I would run into problems due to being restricted to Google apps but so far, so good. In fact, it's made my life even easier because I've been able to use the touchscreen to sign documents that I otherwise would have had to print, sign and scan.As someone who often suffers ""buyer's remorse"" after a large purchase, I haven't regretted buying this laptop for a moment! I absolutely feel like I got my money's worth out of it.",2,4,5,4,5
702,I bought as a present for my father for Fathers Day and his birthday. Its lightweight and alot faster than our old one! So far so good! He only uses it to read news and maybe play a card game here or there but its perfect for him!,3,4,5,4,3
703,"This is not the best laptop out there. It is not the best tablet out there. It is, however, exactly what it claims to be. It is a solid Chromebook, with an S Pen. It is easy to use. It is faster than most tablets. It runs Android apps (mostly, but it is still in Beta and it shows). My only complaint and the only reason why it gets four stars instead of five is because the hand writing input is restricted to the Google handwriting input; having used several other devices with S Pen and the Samsung keyboard, the Google input is a letdown. Paired with the INKredible android app, this is a near perfect Chromebook. If keyboard apps ever start working, it will be a 5 star from me.Pros: Inductive stylus, handwriting recognition, Android apps (beta), light, USB C.Cons: Limited to Google keyboard / handwriting for input. There are much better keyboards for handwriting on Android, including he Samsung Keyboard used on other Samsung devices.",2,4,5,4,5
704,"This is an absolutely bare bones computer, with a puny price tag to match. RAM (just 4 GB) and storage (32 GB) is extremely limited, and non-ugradeable, though there is an SD slot you can use for external storage. (Be aware cards stick out of the slot when in use, so leaving them in while traveling is ill advised.) The processor speed and graphics are also minimal. This isn't for gaming, photo or video editing, or heck, really even video watching, since the storage is so limited, though it streams OK, at least via YouTube.What this is good for is price conscious folks who need a second (or third, etc) laptop on hand for browsing or the occasional video stream. My kids are too young, in our estimation, to have their own computers (3 under 10), but there are also things that they do in school (on Chromebooks) that they'd like to replicate at home, like in-browser learning games, a few streaming sites, etc. For those simple tasks and, say, occasional email or Skyping, this is perfect.If we've got one kid on the iPad and a parent on the home's primary computer, which happens fairly often, this offers a low-cost third option to quickly order something on Amazon, play a Prodigy math game or do school-required typing tests. It's also low cost enough that it allows me to let my kids work semi-unsupervised (like, not with me standing over their should the whole time), without worrying about dropping, breaking off keys, etc. And, yes, all those things have already occurred with our pricier laptops in the past, which is how we learned that lesson, but with this one I don't cringe at the potential replacement/repair cost. It's not quite disposable but, in comparison to our Macbook Pro or iPad, it almost feels that way.Yes, you get what you pay for, but if what you want is a low-cost, no-frills browsing/email laptop that runs Windows, this is a good deal, with a decent screen and keyboard for the price. (And, yes, as an all Apple household, I think exposing the kids to other OS is also beneficial and this is a way to do so on the cheap.)",3,4,5,4,3

713,"You won't find better specs for the money. Both M2 SSD and 1TB HDD. 5400RPM is pretty terrible but better than no drive. Forget all the petty complaints. People are clueless and blame the hardware. Run all the Windows updates as soon as you unbox it over Ethernet cable and not WIFI to avoid issues. Then after all Windows updates complete and you have OS Build 1709, right click the Dell updater in the icon tray next to the clock on the toolbar and scan for Dell updates and drivers.After doing all of these steps first, I have had zero lag, zero Chrome browser issues, etc. Lastly, go to Nvidia's website and install GeForce Experience. From there you can download and install the latest drivers for the GTX 1050. Most Motherboards have on-board graphics but when the Nvidia drivers are installed they take default GPU. I wish this laptop had a metal chassis but for the price point I'm being unrealistic. The plastic case really isn't that bad. Buy this thing and have no regrets.",1,0,1,2,2
714,"This is really my backup/travel computer. I have a high-end model that I do not like to take on the road. I purchased this model to fill in that gap. It has virtually everything I need. Backlit. Light. Good graphics. I don't game with it, so I can't speak to gaming. I only gave it 4 stars for a couple of reasons. 1) The on-off key is located on the upper right of the keyboard, right next to the DELETE key. I can't say how many times I've gone to delete something and accidentally turned off the machine. 2) The ARROW keys are in a funky arrangement, and they are inappropriately sized.All in all though, I like the machine. Since I keep everything on a cloud anyway, I'm not too concerned if this dies. But it's been very reliable. It starts incredibly fast. Some features are much better than my Yoga. No touch-screen though. But that would have added some serious $$ to the price.",3,3,3,2,4

722,"We have several tablets in our family, but this is actually the first laptop we have used in a few years. The Microsoft Surface Laptop combines some of the best features of a tablet, such as touch screen capability, thin and lightweight portability, and features like facial recognition software, with some of the dedicated laptop features that I have been wanting for a while, such as a permanent keyboard and touch pad. At less than three pounds, this really is a remarkable unit that boasts the power of a PC with the footprint of an iPad Pro.There are a few features here that I especially appreciate, such as the surprisingly soft textured keyboard cover that I was not at all expecting. Not only does the speckled gray color blend nicely with the laptop exterior, but it's easy on my wrist and fingers when typing or scrolling along the touch pad. Beyond the keyboard, which is much sturdier than the portable Bluetooth keyboards that I have used with my iPad over the years (that consistently fall apart after a few months), this responsive touchscreen works just as well as my iPad Air 2. It's very easy to shift from keyboard to touch pad to touchscreen depending upon what I am working on or trying to accomplish.Although I have not used many laptops in recent years, I found this unit to be very reliable and on point based on my knowledge of what is available in the market. The 8GG RAM makes this unit quite fast and responsive--in fact one of the best I have encountered on a PC. As with most modern laptops, the hard drive is solid state which allows for greater ease and reliability when travelling. The drive has 256GB which holds plenty of video, music, and document files. I use this to supplement my larger desktop computer at home, but it is perfectly functional and has the capacity to serve as someone's primary or only PC on a regular day-to-day basis.I am in a unique position in terms of brand loyalty because I have almost excessively been a Microsoft user in terms of computers while at the time only really using Apple mobile devices. There is definitely a convergence of styles here with this laptop. In fact, just looking at the white box with its minimalist, streamlined design, I could have sworn I was opening an iPad Pro or something similar from Apple. Even the charger is somewhat reminiscent of an Apple unit (although in black). If you are traditionally a MacBook user, I think you will find plenty to like with this Surface Laptop. All in all, I was very impressed and will make good use of this at home, in the office, and on the go.",0,2,3,2,4

734,"Disclaimer: I was in it for the Android Apps....I've been using Chromebooks full time for about two months now (Two different Acer models). I know that's a small sampling, but I'm on my computer all day at work so I've definitely been able to put them through their paces. I'm a huge fan. They are so simple, fast, and reliable. I have one big annoyance with them. In my job, I have two different Office 365 accounts. This means that if I am logged into one I have to log out and completely close the browser (along with all of my tabs), reopen, and log into the other account if I need to use it.Then of course I'll immediately need something from the other account and have to switch back. Desktop apps like Outlook solve this problem on PCs and Macs.That's why I was so excited to see that Android apps are available for this Chromebook. That solves my one big problem. I can download an app and have both of my email/calendar accounts easily accessible. Unfortunately, they don't work as smoothly as I had hoped. They force quit themselves several times during the setup process and just don't seem stable. I know, I know...it's a beta thing. Still, should be mentioned. Some apps I wanted wouldn't work at all.How does it compare to the other two Chromebooks I own? If you take price out of the equation it's great. The screen is excellent, the touch screen is responsive, the pen is a nice touch. It feels well made. However, I have a feeling I'll very rarely fold this thing over and use it as a tablet until the apps work properly. To me, this means it's not worth the premium. The $284 Acer Chromebook 14 is a way better value.Pros:-Great screen (I actually really prefer the 3:2 aspect ratio to 16:9)-Pen is cool, works well-Tablet mode works well, touch screen is properly responsive-Trackpad is excellentCons:-Android apps are a failure so far (I'm assuming this will change...hope it's soon)-Price (since android apps don't really add much to the experience). If this thing was $375 it would be the best on the market.",2,4,5,4,5

I spent the weekend doing research on this to discover that my older router (apple airport express) was to blame. Apparently older routers rely on a radiative wave dispersion for signals.. the newer routers utilize a beam technology. At least this is how it was explained to me. Regardless, a new router for a hundred bucks has spend this computer up to 58 Mbps. All of my other devices picked up speed as well.So now I am extremely pleased.",2,4,5,4,5

765,"Ive been looking for a replacement for my 5-year-old MacBook Air and I think I may have finally found it in the Surface Laptop by Microsoft. There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard Ive used yet- Precision touchpad is the best Ive used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but wheres charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyIve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. Id already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasnt an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didnt take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSIve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but thats not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. Theres some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and theres a special coating on it to help keep it clean. Im not that worried about it, but just in case, Ill probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while Im using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one. Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. Thats it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish wouldve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port wouldve helped future-proof the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but its not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when youre traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. Its colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I wouldve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but arent the best for reading documents and websites. I dont mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that its not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldnt be disabled in the Full HD version. I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreenduh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that youre likely to use it on this screen. Whenever Ive used the touchscreen, its been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, theyre still laptop speakers, but theyre some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so muchmore than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptops. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. Its fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers arent making the switch is beyond me, but I think its a huge mistake. If youre a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why youve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a pro or gaming laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD thats integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so Im really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. Ive read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You cant get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devils advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that dont need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so its definitely a compromise thats understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably wont be that noticeable unless youre frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasnt going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. Im used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didnt even know Marvell made wireless cards. Ive had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what Ive read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what Im getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously cant store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but thats true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything theyd learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, its a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, Id say its no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I dont think theyll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and theres no other laptop Id rather have right now.",1,2,3,2,4
766,"OK just a few notes. The computer runs well but a few side notes:Although the GTX 1050 TI is now listed as being the minimum recommended for VR, it is NOT VR ready. A test by Occulus Rift program shows it to not meet the minimum requirements.The computer uses a dual display driver system. This means that not all games will utilize the Nvidia GTX 1050 TI card. It may utilize the Intel 630 and run Nvidia for the Physics only. (though I bench-marked this system with both Valley and Furmark, the individual game will ultimately decide which card will run when playing. You can select the Physics to run Nvidia under global or application. I.E. Fallout 4 will default to the on-board Intel 630 GFX processor. This doesn't mean that it does not run well it does, you are simply not getting all the optimization from the GTX 1050 TI Card.)Furthermore the Nvidia Ge-force Experience program will not run with this system currently. I am looking into this further with Nvidia. Apparently in its 2d running state the program cannot detect the 1050 TI and therefore will not optimize anything.For the prices this is a very good mid-rangeMSI GL62M 7REX-1896US 15.6"" Full HD Thin and Light Gaming Laptop Computer Quad Core i7-7700HQ, GeForce GTX 1050Ti 4G Graphics, 8GB DRAM, 128GB SSD + 1TB Hard Drive, Steelseries Red Backlit Keyboardlaptop, but if you want an MSI laptop with switchable gfx you will need anything in the GT line of Laptops.",2,0,1,2,2

Some points that may be helpful to some people: My computer crashed after playing games and having a video open in Chrome. From my experience the computer life is no where near what is advertised. It's more like 5-6 hours rather then 10. Also, a bit disappointed that it didn't come with a longer, more sturdy power cord with a ground. Just came with a standard two pronged power adapter.

826,"This review is specifically for the 14"" L402-WA-EH21.First off, a little bit of background: I am a computer person. I build, rebuild, and maintain computers both in professional and personal life.The Good Things-This computer is light weight, easy to use, feels good to type on, and starts fairly quick. Everything about this PC is built specifically to be lightweight and slim. It is specifically built to do web browsing, emailing, instant messaging, and lightweight document creation. Think of it like a Chromebook but running windows. Youtube videos run smooth, network (while n compatible, ac-based) is wifi is zippy but wired is faster, and the screen is bright and vivid (with the right settings). If you are student that needs a budget document creation tool, this will do it. If you need a computer to quickly look up information, close and toss around the living room, or send emails to grandma; this machine will do it.It also has a 2.5"" harddrive bay in a cover under the bottom of the laptop (not advertised but it's there). I have installed (and highly recommend) a 250gb ssd for the additional storage space (and if you are going to be doing any type of heavy document creation, you will need the space). It works fine without reducing battery life.At the moment, the longest I have used it was 3 hours before plugging it in, but that was because I was leaving for several hours. probably would have made 4 before having to plug it in.The Not-So-Good Things-The L402WA-EH21 has no documentation online, has no specs listed through the ASUS website, and apparently doesn't exist other than it is listed on Amazon for sale. The closest model is the E402WA on the ASUS site and comes in two different versions (i think the E is Intel based, the L is AMD based). Given that you are considering purchasing this laptop, all the documentation that you will have will come in the box; a basic start up manual, a warranty card, a small bag of screws (for the harddrive expansion bay), and a power supply.The Bad Things-I received this laptop and plugged it in and fired it up. Standard Windows set up and logged into the desktop. Always first thing to do is to check that Windows activated itself properly. It did not. Alright, so I thought there might be a problem with the OS that was installed on it, so I restored the system using the builtin restoration partition (takes about 45 minutes). I redid the Windows set up, and waited. Same information was stored in the restoration partition as was in the original install. Windows wouldn't activate.Alright, being a computer guy, I dug out the tools and scanned the keys that were installed from Asus. The version of Windows installed was 10Home, the key installed through BiOS/UEIF was a 10RTMCore, and had an origin key of 10RTMCloud. All three of these keys are for different versions, none of which are interchangeable with each-other.If you research the OS that is suppose to be installed on this computer (Windows 10S) you will find that it is identical and interchangeable with W 10Pro. Being a computer guy, I wiped the boot drive and installed Windows 10Pro from a flash drive (takes about 45 mins), did the Windows set up, had the OS pull the key from BiOS ... Windows not active...!At this point I was at a loss as what to do. I did a few activation tricks and called Microsoft Activation to see if i could manually activate Windows 10Pro. Talking to a Third Tier Tech (first two were impatient and useless, about 45 minutes being bounced around), the Tech checked the three keys that I had. The W 10H key was already registered and in use (so dead), and the W 10RTMCore and 10RTMCloud had not called home properly. YES! Two keys were available, one of them was no longer viable. Here's the nail in the coffin, I asked the Tech where I could get a ISO (the installer disk) for Windows 10 S (10RTMCloud). His exact answer ""Unfortunately, there is no way for you to get ahold of a 10S ISO image. They are distributed directly to manufacturers only."" ... Great... Just great...So... After all of that I had a brand new key, a new laptop, and no way to put the OS on it that it was suppose to be installed! Mind you, this is five hours into taking it out of the box. I finally was just about to throw it back in and ship it back when I decided to dig around in Google.So... after about an hour, I found a fix. It's complicated, it's doable if you are moderately computer savvy, and have about two hours of time; no software needed to be stolen or borrowed from illegitimate sources or anything.1. Get a Windows 10Pro image set and ready on a flashdrive and bootable.2. Install 10 Pro onto the laptop WITHOUT changing any partition information (simply delete the OS partition and stall Windows 10Pro in its place) and bypass the key entry section during install.3. Once the computer is set up and running at the desktop, check to see if the key has Activated. IF IT HAS YOU ARE FINISHED. If not, continue.4. If Windows 10Pro did not activate, you need to find the installer for W 10S. You cannot obtain an ISO, you must use an 'Upgrade' like installer. The webpage to search for is ""Test Windows 10 S on existing Windows 10 education devices"". Read most of the page so you know what you're getting into, and download the installer.5. Run the installer. It will do an 'Upgrade' install, move all of the associated profile information to a Windows.old folder on the C drive, and install Windows 10S.6. Alright, you've done this step before. Go through the Windows 10 set up.7. Once you get to the desktop, check to see if Windows 10S has been activated. At this point, Windows 10 pulled the key from the BiOS/UEIF and registered properly!8a. At this point you are ready to run. Go ahead and use the laptop as you want. You will need to run DiskCleanup as administrator to wipe out the Windows 10Pro files that are completely useless and just taking up the tiny storage.8b.If you plan on installing any software that is not Windows 10S verified (through the Windows Store) to be lightweight, this laptop HAS the ability to be upgraded to pro through the Store. Search for 'Upgrade to Pro'. It will upgrade you straight away without installing anything else. Everything that Windows 10Pro needs is already in 10S, anything that isn't will need to be downloaded and installed (which if you need them, you will know where to find them in Programs & Features through the Control Panel).Final Thoughts-Generally, I like this lightweight system. It does exactly what I need it to do; run several messengers, word processing, quick internet searches, basic presentations, and occasionally watching Twitch. If you need a small computer, this will do the trick! If you need something to run Photoshop, you will need something more powerful. If this system had of been manufactured with the proper OS on it at the getgo, it would have gotten a 4/5 Star rating... Seriously.... SIX hours of my life are gone because someone in OSImaging didn't get the memo that the BiOS/UEIF had a Windows 10S and not Windows 10Home, or 10RTMCore... If you manage to get this system with Windows 10S and not have to go through a ton of set up, or have the technical ability to do EVERYTHING I did it will be a good lightweight system. At the moment, I cannot confirm that any of the units available have the proper OS on them. I have posted the above information for anyone that might run into the same problem and really REALLY want to give the system a good shot before throwing it back in the box and sending it back.",3,1,5,4,3

833,"Who am I? I am a girl with small hands (this might be important) who is a college student that has changed studies from a heavy-software-dependent major (arch/design) to a book/textbook/writing-major (PR/econ). So I knew I wanted a laptop that is very lightweight and easy to handle in my hands whenever i have to move from place to place. I never failed to bump my old asus laptop and i loathed the feeling. Besides, almost everywhere you sit in college, desk space is scarce, especially in the classroom or everywhere else you sat that was not the dorm or library. And I hated having my old big screen asus notebook out in the open. So for my new studies, I decided to try a smaller laptop to ease my worries and troubles. It has been a year now and i love it... although i have the old version and my screen does turn black at weird times. (about 10 times so far)Who do i recommend this product to?I am recommending it to my brother who is about to start college with basic classes lined up. I never tried heavy software on this laptop so I am not sure what happens if you install it. I believe it has low capacity to handle the latter. This is for someone who doesn't mind the small screen size and keyboard, and personally, someone who doesn't want a heavy bulky laptop when you depend on writing, maybe reading, internet surfing, quick tasks, basic school-workload. This laptop is the sole definition of portable and you can move it from place to place with the confidence that it will never slip away from your hands. (i recommend getting a case also) It is also fairly responsive. Doesn't take long to load ...that is if you keep it simple.In my college courses, i see lots of students with big-screen computers like macs and hp's. I dont see it necessary when you are taking the classes in the liberal arts, business, core classes, etc. I even know people in the engineering and architecture classes who either want an extra small laptop for its ease or have one already. I've had this laptop for almost a year and when I was still in arch/design school I would only use my old big asus to handle the heavy software and use my small laptop for everything else. All i needed was a USB to connect both laptops with the information i always needed.Now i use my small asus for everything. The price is really nice too.FWI: this is the first review i've written in my life for a product.

The ambient light sensor and fingerprint readers need additional drivers that I haven't installed (because I don't want those features), but the rest of the hardware works perfectly on a default install. I Installed TLP and thermald and I'm getting the stated 9hrs of battery life with moderate usage. Additionally, this laptop doesn't include some of the things that don't play well with Linux yet, such as 360/tablet mode, touch screen, and 4k resolution. Honestly couldn't be happier with it as a replacement for my Macbook Air.Tip: out of the box you have to do a few things to be able to enter the BIOS so you can disable secure boot and tweak the boot manager to boot to your Linux install. Amazon won't let me post links to that info in this review, but you can find it with a little searching.Final Note: I didn't hear the fan ""whine"" as others have reported. Based on everything I've read this was a Windows specific problem that was fixed in later software updates.",3,2,2,0,3

848,"Chromebooks have always been a strange beast. Positioned as a budget pc and specialized for people who solely use the internet for most things. The attractive price and portability have been tempting for students, (should I mention budget again?). The problem was the pretty terrible selection of apps in the chrome store, low amounts of ram and generally anemic performance. Generally I've been the type of person to buy full powered 17"" gaming laptops (for their performance and ability to reasonably have two documents up at once) and avoid tiny screens and simplified products (i.e chromebooks and smaller laptops). I say this typing on a 14"" Asus laptop that is no way comparable to anything worthy of the word gaming.So intro out of the way here's my situation and hopefully this gives some insight. I am very familiar with Samsungs Note line of products. I have a Note 3, Note 4 and Note 10.1 (2014 edition). I DAILY use the stylus function on the 10.1 for school. I hate paper, and cant keep it organized either. So that Note 10.1"" was my everything for about two full semesters, even with its weird 16:9 display not matching the format for a standard 8.5X11"" piece of paper. Lately it's been performing strangely, is well outdated (thanks samsung) and unless you're familiar with modifying the OS, its pretty much time to move along. (constant crashing during class causing loss of notes and corruption of others is completely unacceptable).So I started looking for alternatives, The TAB A with S-Pen or Tab S2 are pretty insanely priced, though those OLED displays are face meltingly beautiful. So what were my options? Buy the 12.1 2014 edition? Thats not gonna help. Luckily this was a brand new option that was available.Being skeptical, a 15 day return policy from a certain Blue Box retailer with its notable lack of creepy smiley face logos everywhere and no mart in its name made it easy enough to take it for a test drive.Okay, cut the crap right? Got it.This Laptop/2in1/chromebook whatever you want to call it is very impressive, as long as you understand the limitations. The display is beautiful with its high resolution display, near infinite viewing angles, excellent colors and VERY punchy brightness thats great for outdoors. I regularly find myself staying at 50% brightness for comfortable indoor use in bright areas, or lower at night.Battery life is incredible. for something so small with a bright screen, the battery life easily lasts all day, writing notes, browsing the internet etc. Games and video do put the hurt on it though.Construction:Fantastic, no real noticable flex, screen with my palm on it on tablet mode offers little if any noticable flex. Its REALLY thin, and light. and from a distance looks like a product from a certian cultish fruit themed computer company, except I didnt have to sell my internal organs to afford something with annoyingly crippled hardware. Its sports two USB Type C ports, a headphone jack (so unbrave of them to include this right?) and a microsd card slot for more storage.It runs on USB Type C!I thought it was strange at first since I hate having to carry another adapter to connect/charge devices (friggen dongles man). But its not so bad since if youre in a stretch, you can use a powerbank or even your phone charger if your batteries low and you need life support. IT will barely keep it alive, but thats better than it being dead. This is very welcome during long study sessions before calculus tests at your local 24h diner.Now usability wise?This is chrome OS, so were screwed right? Not really, googles been working on giving you access to the android store, which is what sold me on this device really. You go from terrible apps, to the play stores excellent selection, that most apps work on. My note taking app of choice is Inkredible, which is available on Android or iOS and LEAUGES better than SNote or anything ive seen from the iOS store. Plus the Dev is a pretty cool person and helped me upgrade from regular to pro when pro was released, (i bought every feature for the regular app and well exceeded the price for pro which had almost the same features).This combined with the S-pen is pen, makes this a killer note taking device since it gets palm rejection from the app, and the excellent wacom backed writing supplied by the pen, IT works with any Note 3/4 compatible stylus which is pretty awesome.Android apps work almost flawlessly, some strange hiccups are present, since the store is still in beta, but games work mostly well, my Inkredible works great and often most of the google android based apps work better than anything chrome can supply.The strangest thing is that Android is run in a sandboxed evironment.What does this mean? Well Chrome OS is designed to be very secure, which is great for the less savvy users, but this locked down environment doesn't play well with androids setup, so Google has Android ""fenced in"" in its own little world, where it cant affect/harm the main pc. It gives access to features it needs in a ""grapevine"" sort of fashion. This means that there are certain strange things that happen, Your android apps cannot see the full storage option on your device, only the downloads folder. Printing in android apps does not work well with network shared printers, wifi printers maybe but I dont have one so I cant test that. This makes transferring files strange, but doable. Grab a file manager, use the google file manager to download your game saves/documents/data files from your favorite apps, dump em in the downloads folder via the chrome files app, then use an android file manager to move them around as needed or transplant them into the file folder present in the root of your android install.Games can get a little laggy as this processor isnt the greatest, but most run just fine. My biggest complaint is there does seem to be a little bit of an afterimage or ghosting present on the display for faster moving games, but who cares for this price.Well in any case, I think I've said enough, Its not perfect, but it's damn near close. I'm a month in, and I have no regerets, especially since I got one from the amazon warehouse in virtually new condition for well under the full asking price due to the recent crazy sales. It also helps that google gives you a $20 credit for the play store.Have fun and try it out, you may just find it replaces your light computing and tablet needs.",2,4,5,4,5

852,"I've been a devoted Windows user since the early 90s. In parallel, and in counterpoint, I've also cycled through countless Windows laptops over the years, including Compaq, HP and Dell, and often been disappointed with the longevity of the machines. I nevertheless retained my affinity for the Windows operating system---so much so that when I purchased a MacBook Pro last year, I partitioned the disk and continued operating under Windows 10. I therefore greeted news of the Surface Laptop this spring---with its sleek and unitary design, and integration with other Microsoft products---with great enthusiasm. At last, I thought, the hardware would rise to the level of the software. The Surface Laptop would be Microsoft's answer to Apple.Alas, upon buying the machine (indeed, the highest-end model), I found myself severely disappointed.First of all, it ran noisy and hot right out of the box. Second, I could not even obtain a full-screen display on a standard Samsung external monitor (a defect which could not be resolved through a lengthy call to Microsoft Tech Support). How could Microsoft overlook such a basic requirement?After several hours of struggling I put the machine back in the box and returned it for a full refund.

865,"For the price, this laptop can be pretty good depending on how you're going to use it. It's on the cheap end of laptop market with $170. For it's price it is an amazing laptop, however it does has it's shortcomings. I'll add some pros and cos for you guys:Pros:- Very slim, lightweight, portable laptop and build pretty well considering it costs about $170.- Battery life is amazing, it lasted me 8 hours on regular day-to-day usage. With movies or YouTube it lasted about 5 hours. I've had much expensive laptops running out of battery within 3-4 hours.- Keyboard and touchpad feel good. I don't have any complaints about the touchpad or keyboard other than no backlight on the keyboard. Of course it's a cheap laptop you can't expect it to have everything.- For multimedia purposes, this laptop is perfect. It can stream 4K videos (provided you use Edge and not Chrome or Firefox). I did however ran into problems with 8K videos. Running video files locally i didn't run into any problems either. It plays all files perfectly.- Display is very nice although not the brightest, it still is very good with 1080p crisp image quality. Viewing angles are not that bad either but it is a TN panel so do expect not being able to view laptop properly from more angular places.- You could ""light"" game on this laptop. By light i mean really light, like old school 3d games, 2d games and some emulators pre Dreamcast.Cons:- You will run into ""ran out of memory"" problems A LOT. If you have even 4-5 tabs open in any browser, laptop will slow down and you'd have to close some tabs.- No expansion slots meaning you'd have to rely on the USB ports to have more storage, which you're going to need considering this laptop only has 32 gb HD.- Cannot upgrade windows 10 to the latest version due to not having enough space. Without having to install anything at all, you get about 8 gb space. I still haven't figured out how to use the external storage for windows update and ended up disabling updates all together.- SD Card slot is a shallow one, meaning if you insert a standard SD card it'll stick out half way. You can get smaller half-size memory card adaptors (you can insert micro sd cards in those) but that'll cost you more money. Not having a SD card that fits inside can be problematic as it can hinder the ability to carry laptop in bag without fear of breaking or ejecting the card in the process.Conclusion:To me this laptop has equal amount of pros and cons hence, i decided to give it 3 stars. It's a very good deal for money but if you get annoyed by the cons mentioned, it's better you add some more money for a better laptop. It all depends on what you want the laptop for, what it's main purpose is.",3,4,5,4,3

This is Chrome OS version 56 (is in beta testing on android). Apps due got to full screen, but the window is small text and not fully proportioned to the screen, best to leave these in native size ( think large phone). Too bad you came have a couple Android windows positioned side by side. A bit of puffiness here : not sure Android is working all that well, I see crashes often and it is still better to use Chrome extensions of you can, like Office 365.Pen input is based on other Samsung products and I think it is an s-pen, really unique. Get the Chrome extension for Google Keep installed and a lovely app on the Android side is ""Squid"" as it gives a college rule page to write on. At this price point, can't help but love hand writing recognition etc. Drawing is fun too.Battery life is OK. But do know you have a bright screen so 7 hours is the norm. It's love 10-12 hours.Touch pad and screen will work fine. Use both or one in concert with the task.No reason to get the pro, I know there's lots of hype about it. Not needed unless you are doing something like video editing (get real Samsung), as the Plus model has hardly any lag and if you want to pay over $500 it is your money.It really didn't replace a tablet for me, the screen is about space for productivity. It's not a good substitute for an iPad but definitely is a replacement fire the Macbook Air. Chrome is not for media generation, other that light photo editing tasks. Polarr is a good extension for that.Have fun!",2,4,5,4,5

892,"As a fan of Asus laptops, I found the P2540UA disappointing. Yes, it's aimed at business users, but almost everyone that uses a laptop sneaks in occasional multimedia use, at the very least. While the business features are strong and the laptop is more than fine for office tasks, it's extremely weak at multimedia.On the business side, the laptop's long battery life (fairly accurate to Asus' claims) and security features are commendable. The matte screen is a nice option for road warriors that need to get things done in public places that are sunny.One of the worst things about this laptop is its slow mechanical hard drive. The only reason its used is to keep the price down. Mechanical hard drives are slow and have poor longevity compared to solid state drives. Between the sorry hard drive and relatively modest specs, this laptop fails with modern media.There are Asus consumer laptops that cost slightly more than this model. They are far more versatile than this model, offering performance that can handle business and multimedia use. I can't recommend this laptop when you can get a far better one for $100-200 more.",2,2,1,2,2
893,"I have used this computer for 3 months. I can only recommend this computer to someone that is skilled at computer repair!!!Pros:It plays games like PUBG, witcher 3 and Watch Dogs 2 with high/ultra settings at the screens refresh rate, which is 75Hz.Plenty of storage if you don't mind a little longer load times from the 7200 RPM hdd. Also storage is easily expanded.Not that hard to replace/upgrade ram.Opening up the computer is not complicated and I didn't see a single warranty void sticker.The battery times are better then advertised. With light use it has lasted ~4 hours to 20% remaining.BUT! It had several issues from the factory,Cons:It would freeze randomly! Total lock up that needed the power button held down to turn off. This went away only after I installed the latest version of the BIOS. This is not something to be taken lightly as you can brick the computer during this process if not careful.It is now stable with no crashes or other errors.The speakers create a noticeable rattle/buzz at certain frequency's. Its somewhere under the keyboard. I try not to use them much because of this. Not the biggest deal for me.It gets really hot. The factory thermal paste is not good. Too much and poor quality, as everyone knows. This is an ongoing issue for this computer. I have re-pasted the CPU and GPU with ARCTIC MX-4. Before I was getting up to 97c with heavy gaming quite quickly. Within ~30 mins. Now I still get up to 97c but much more slowly, about 4 hours. And with most games it only gets to about 83c. I plan on re-pasting again with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut.I also have the CPU under volted by .120 volts.

I have a dual monitor setup at work that I was able to continue to use sine there is both a HDMI video and VGA video output ports. The Gen 7 i5 was a nice sweet spot for me. The fit and finish is not supper but for $500 bucks I'm OK with it. I travel everyday back and forth to work with the laptop and as long as you have a decent size bag (I have a large enough messenger bag) you should be good to go. Since this thing is all plastic if you do not have a decent laptop slot in your bag with good cushioning I would suggest you pick up a Laptop sleeve for some extra protection. I made a backup image of Win 10 build it shipped with and reinstalled the machine with Linux Mint, it has been running like a champ no issues. I only have two projects left to finish up my planned changes for the laptop. I will be bumping it up to 16GB of RAM (Not a big deal it comes with a single 8GB dim) you just need to order another 8GB dim and I will be ready to roll. The last change after that is I would like to ditch the included optical drive and install a second internal storage device, maybe even through to 1TB drive it came with back in there (It is a 5400RPM drive, made me sad) Afer that my Frankenstein build will be completed.At $500 it is worth the cash.

The Laptop's own display is extremely sharp and gorgeous, although some apps don't yet support high density displays, but overall it's nice.

The keyboard is surrounded by amazing fabric that is light on your wrists while typing (no it doesn't stink and hasn't changed colors) and the keys with 1.5 mm travel feel like a premium keyboard.

922,"My Nexus 9 tablet was getting so old that it felt like it was time to upgrade to a new one, but with Chromebooks now offering Android App support, I thought I'd give this a shot. I liked the fact that it had a keyboard yet was slim and lightweight, but I was concerned about performance. Luckily I think I made the right choice with this.Form Factor / Build Quality- This notebook looks and feels really slick. It's slim, lightweight yet durable. It feels really premium. The display is gorgeous and you can easily run it at 40% brightness and still see everything. The 4:3 ratio while unusual for a laptop these days, but it works great in tablet and tent mode.Performance- I was concerned about the performance since this was using what's basically a phone processor instead of an Intel computer processor. I was pleasantly surprised to see it worked great though. I've used it for about a week now and I've haven't had any stuttering or maxing out on memory. I've had at 20 tabs opens, used Android apps, streams several 1080p YouTube videos and they've always worked fine.Android Apps- So far, it seems like about 90% of the apps I used on my tablet are available on the Chromebook Plus and run pretty well. The Microsoft Office apps aren't available at this point which was a bit of a disappointment. I had one or two games that crashed a few times, but other than that, it's been clear sailing. I assume this will get fixed in the future as developers adjust their apps to work on ChromebooksBattery Life- The battery life is really nice. I would say the 7 - 8 hours they mention is about right. It's double what I was getting on my old tablet or my laptop from 2 years agoFinal Verdict- Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase. It runs well, is light and does everything I need it to. I would recommend it for someone who wants a secondary device (like a tablet or couch computer) for sure. I'm not sure if ChromeOS is ready to be a full on laptop replacement yet, but it's getting very close.",2,4,5,4,5
923,"Great for a student. Super quick, has 12gb free after Windows Google Chrome and Ms office, which it comes with pre downloaded. Nice build quality as always with asus. Overall good choice for $200",3,1,5,4,3
924,"Fantastic, the best computer until now.",2,4,5,4,5
925,"I got burned on the original Surface when it came out (I had an RT which was horrible, so I traded for a Pro with Win8). That Surface got slower and slower with its many, many updates, to where the system was so bogged down that it was unusable. On top of that, hardware challenges began to show after a few weeks and by month three I loved it a lot less than on Day One. So I waited a few months before reviewing this laptop to see if it had similar issues.Fortunately, Microsoft seems to have ironed out a lot of the issues. This laptop may not have all the cool-hip factor of a convertible tablet, but its full-sized keyboard and solid casing are eminently practical while its feather weight and ultra-slim profile still keep it in the fashionably-cool category. Mine has and i5 processor and 8GB of RAM and that seems adept at most things I do (it's only a little sluggish with some games like Forza 6 and with Access). Were I chronically trying to do either, I would splurge for the i7/16GB, but the entry set will work for most tasks.The keyboard is responsive. My only gripe is my 30-year history of right-handed Control+Enter is busted by this keyboard's layout, which replaces the right control key with a menu key and no easy way to re-map it. It is backlight, but more a hint of backlit than my VAIO or Alienware, which actually makes it more eye-friendly in the dark. The large track pad is very responsive and reads the full range of touch and swipe options (some of which are turned off my default - weird).The aluminum case is sharp looking, though my dented pretty easily while in my laptop bag with my mouse. The power cord attach is magnetic, with a bar clip that makes aligning it a snap (ba da ch!). I will say the battery default power setting lets it drain pretty quickly, so if you're like me and use yours while flying, you may consider switching to lower-power options (this gets me from about 6 hours of heavy use to 12 - a nice leap, especially considering it's not the fastest charging device).Finally, for what it's worth: I do not like Win10S any more than I liked Win8RT. I know it makes the system lighter, faster, and more Android/iOS-ish, but it also makes it impossible to run my work software, any legacy software, and just in general I reject the idea (been using Microsoft since the DOS 3.0 days, so I guess I'm stuck in the mindset of me telling my computer what it will do, not the other way around). So for my 2 cents, just upgrade to full Windows 10 when you get it. The upgrade is free for the remainder of 2017, and only $50 beginning in 2018 (purchase via the Windows Store).",1,2,3,2,4
926,Bought this so that the wife could have something to use to watch Netflix while I hogged the XBOX playing games. She loves it! It has decent sound from the stock speakers and the included s pen is really cool as well. Setup was a breeze and the Google app store has more options than a traditional pc. Battery life is actually a lot better than one would expect and lasts a coupleDays with moderate daily use. The option to use an additional storage using a micro as card isn't seen very often with chrome books. All in all I believe Samsung produced a stellar product with this one!,2,4,5,4,5
927,"Excellent when it works. It is now dead. The screen started to strobe. It wouldn't open programs, which I had to reinstall. Then it quietly switched itself off...with a full battery...and it won't re-start. Since the battery is integral, there is no resetting it by removing and replacing the battery. Will trouble shoot but little more than two months of light use and it is dead? Disappointing.",2,0,3,2,2
928,"4 Stars So far :-DI just received this little laptop yesterday (a day earlier than expected thank you amazon). So I have not really had a chance to put it through it's paces yet. But so far so good. I can confirm that the display screen is a bit weak and I have yet to figure out how to increase the color saturation (as some suggested can be done to improve) but it serves it's purpose for what I need it to do. When my better 1/2 saw me setting it up (which was spoon fed simplicity) she stated the screen looked terrible. When I turned the screen towards her her response was oh that's better but still not great. Although the display is a bit unimpressive it's not a deal killer for me as I can link this to my tv via full size HDMI that has a beautiful display and have wonderful side angle viewing. That feature is one of the main reasons I decided to buy this under $200 unit. It has a lot of ports and since my wife and I went ""mellinial"" and cut off the land line & cable tv I lost all my sports channels. There are tons of sports streaming sites online and I was forced to watch either at my desktop or on my 8"" tablet. I tried to use MHL & Slimport to link my tablet to my 1080p flat screen but my tablet is incompatible for that use. So the feature using just a standard HDMI cable to watch steaming sports on my big screen was a very attractive feature. I will put this feature to the test tonight when my hockey team plays :-D. I can also confirm the track pad does seem a bit flimsy and quirky and besides the display is an indication if the price point of this device. I disabled some of the 2 tap features and use a wireless mouse anyway so it also is not a deal breaker. I honestly think would be hard pressed to find a laptop that has all the features this laptop has and runs windows 10 for under $200 even with the shortcomings this device does have. The limited ssd internal memory is not an issue for me as my desktop has more than I will ever use in a lifetime lol (1 tarabite). Really the big question mark for me is the longevity of the Acer brand. This is the 1st one I have owned and have heard both awesome & terrible things regarding the overall build and how long they hold up. However considering I have seen some high end units go from treasure to trash very quickly ;-) For under $200 I feel this is a good little unit. Did I mention it is under $200 (usd) ;-)Update; hooking up to the tv is a snap! You get 1080p pic and sound via an HDMI cable. I am very pleased as the primary reason for me to purchase is that feature. Having an extra computer is icing on the cake. Very pleased!",3,4,5,4,3

Why Samsung? Why?I was a little worried first to order because I would not get a Swedish keyboard. Plus we have 220 volts in Sweden vs 110 volts in the United States.No problem at all, I can gladly announce.In terms of volts, Samsung is capable of both 220 and 110 volts. So all i had to do to charge my chromebook was to buy an adapter USA to Europe. The keyboard also did not give me any problems. I only added Swedish as a language on my chromebook and then I could write the letters .  and . They are in the same place as on a Swedish keyboard but have other symbols on the keybord of course.So you should not be afraid to buy from Amazon just because you live in Sweden.

963,"This computer may lack some of the bells and whistles of less affordable models, but it is a workhorse. We are using it as the engine of a small recording studio, and it is handling its responsibilities well, literally not missing a beat. While our other laptops are lazily surfing the web or reading emails, the ASUS keeps up with the processing required to transform analog sound into digital data, juggling Adobe products as if they were beachballs. Right now, it's got various pieces of hardware plugged into it, including headphones, a mixer, and a microphone, and there are still ports to spare.Setting up the machine was fast and straightforward, and it's mercifully free of the bloatware that is too often packaged with lower end laptops. I haven't had a chance to test out some of the features, like the long battery life (it hasn't left the studio), but I like the fact that ASUS has nailed so many of the details, especially the keyboard. Most laptop keyboards seem to be tacked on as an afterthought ""guess we need one of these too?"" not the case with this model, with a keyboard that is solid and comfortable.Here in Silicon Valley, you don't see a lot of people sitting in coffee bars with an ASUS propped up next to their double lattes.

Secondly, the speakers sound average at best, but the major issues are due to the speaker's location, which is directly under the computer -- you must have the computer on a straight, solid surface in order to hear the sound -- placing your laptop on your bed or carpet will make the sound very difficult to hear. Thirdly, the battery life is terrible -- if I'm doing the slightest amount of work on my computer, the battery is dead within 1-3 hours. Lastly, if you are into gaming, this computer fails in every category. Obviously, this computer is not designed to handle gaming, but playing games that are very basic, two dimensional, and primitive can barely run. On the plus side, this laptop will fulfill all of your basic needs (Word, PowerPoint, email, small projects, video chat).To reiterate, here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Lightweight- Attractive Design- Performs Small Application Very Well- Light-Up Keyboard- Easy-To-Type Keyboard- Can Handle Programming- Overall Reliable- Thin DesignCons:- Highly Overpriced- Fails To Run Many Applications- Bad Battery Life- Graphics Are Terrible And Replacing The Graphics Card Will Not Help Much (It Is The Computer Itself)- Cannot Be Used For Entertainment Purposes (Netflix, Gaming)",1,2,1,2,3

994,"I have had this laptop for a month, and I use it just about everyday for school and work. It is perfect to take in my backpack! So light and portable. The battery is strong and lasts more than long enough.. Most I have used it for was 10 hours in the library for online math homework. Reception and connectivity is a breeze... It connects to the wifi no problem! Gold is a sexy color too! Yes, It is a little smaller than your average laptop or macbook, but the resolution is good and I find it easy enough to read. The body feel is a heftier more hardy metal than I had seen in other windows models around town. I was personally shopping a TON to decide on a laptop in the 180-350 price range, and it was so hard to decide which laptops were riskiest vs going to be worth it... I decided on this windows ASUS over a google chromebook and I am SO happy I did! ASUS Windows = a great machine. Microsoft edge is also surprisingly fast and useful. The keyboard is quite nice to type on and overall it feels sturdy and the clicking has a ""snappy"" feel that makes working fun.Here is a video of me un-boxing it.SIDE NOTES*Buy a sleeve to go with it for safe keeping.*Get a 3 year warranty! It was 60$. I got one. Have not had to use it yet though.*I have a WD passport drive that I use to store my documents and files, so the hardware disk space wasn't a big factor in buying choice for me. It is a great idea to get an external drive, if you don't have one, get one!",3,1,5,4,3
995,this computer had everything we wanted & needed. I have had NO problems with this computer since day one!,2,2,1,3,2
996,"Like another reviewer, I ended up with an upgraded version of the base-model you see here. So, while I ordered this one, I actually received the 13Z980-A.AAS7U1.Pros:-This is super compact, super thin, and super light.-This is great for work (especially if you commute via public transportation when every ounce counts).-Likewise, great for students with backpacks full of chemistry and calculus books (this adds very little extra weight).-The battery life is impressive (about sixteen hours).-The back-lit keyboard has three settings. It is a nice touch. (It is especially great for the student in your life who is sharing a dorm room and trying to knock-out that overnight paper!)-The matte finish makes this fairly fingerprint resistant.Neutral:-Emulates MacBook layout and ports. (Great if that is a layout you enjoy/prefer).Cons:-There are warnings that state that this computer is known to cause cancer and that the user should wash one's hands after use. Hence, this may not be the best choice for children and adolescents (who may forget to wash their hands).-Although the hinges on the screen are excellent, the screen does slightly wobble as one types.-While not rated for gaming, do know that this laptop will not perform well with games like Dragon Age II or Witcher 3. So, if you were hoping that this could be your gaming computer on the side, you might need a more a powerful laptop.All told, I was truly impressed with the overall capabilities of this laptop. It is fantastic for travel, great for spreadsheets, perfect for watching videos, and has almost ZERO bloatware (I was really pleased with that!).Highly recommended!",3,2,3,2,4
997,i like how light it is. its super sleek and nice looking. i dont like how there is no cd player and no usb port. i didnt know that it didnt include those features. i also don't know if you can extend the one year warrany it comes with.,3,2,5,4,3
998,"Features that wow:Price vs value equation due to discrete Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics processorUpgraded i7 Kaby Lake with less heat, lower power consumptionFast boot with 128 G SSD hard driveGood screen with low light leakageRed backlit full size keyboard with number padUnderstated styling (low bling), but enough to be happyBright TN screenRelatively solid build, soft touch plasticsLow fan noise even under loadRelatively low weight at 5 lbsFeatures that are less impressive:Plastic everywhereSound is averageDell is not known for making its own Dell branded computer gaming powerhousesfor that you have to jump up in price and bling to Alienware. With Dells dedicated Alienware brand you get lots of bells and whistles, including molded style metal cases, very solid builds, full lighting controls, generally nice specs and higher prices. Why change near mid cost perfection with the same case and essentially same innards as the prior i7559 build? This current computer is almost the same with the better Kaby Lake chip set and mostly the same Nvidia GTX1050 (vs GTX 960m). Styling wise the Inspiron is not Alienware, but with some nice red accents on the rear facing under screen grill and a red Dell logo on the lid, the Inspiron distinguishes itself as not your fathers Dell. [Full disclosure, having owned and upgraded from the prior Alienware M11X R3 laptop along with an i7559, I do love Alienware laptops.]First, Kaby Lake intel i7 chipset represents one of the best solutions to lower heat, lower power consumption with higher performance than the prior generation. Same for the Nvidia GTX1050which performance wise during gaming, produces less heat and uses less power for similar performance (if not slightly higher in actual use!) than the prior equivalent graphics processer GTX960. This means that a gaming laptop can be built without it being a vacuum cleaner or jet engine for heat control at load. The current Kaby Lake i7 chip is highly acceptable and powerful enough to run just about anything you can toss.The 128 G SSD comes loaded with Windows 10 and it is suggested to jump immediately to updates at Microsoft and Dell for the latest drivers. [I moved immediately to W10-Creators and had no issues.] I was hoping that under the rear screw panel there might be room for removal of the 1T disc based 5200 RPM HD for replacement with an SSD, but no such luck. I suppose it could be done but it was not turnkey like a couple of prior iterations of this same laptop case. Startup is quick with the main operating system on the 128G SSD, at less than 30 seconds under normal circumstances. The 1T hard drive operates acceptably with Steam game files and other data in place.So Kaby Lake i7 and Nvidia GTX1050 is a perfect lower cost, lower heat alternative and partner with improvements over prior Skylake  GTX960 combo? Yes it is. No, it is not a GTX1060-70-80, each with progressively faster game frame rates, and higher quality settings during gaming, but most will find the 1050 a good alternative to higher prices. Gamers should and would question if the GTX1050 will play the games they want to playand the 1050 may have limits depending on the game. For the games I play the most, I can report full functionality with high settings and Physix running on high settings for all the Borderlands series games, Fallout 4, and DOOM on this capable Dell Inspiron. While I cannot report on actual FPS, there is no obvious slowdowns in full action movement for these games. This laptop does like to be plugged in for game play at these levels, which I am used to from prior laptops. If you are not plugged in, you may have some movement and frame rate stutters in more demanding games at higher settings. The Nvidia 1050 provides low heat output at load. This Dell runs quiet with no audible fan noise at normal loads and tasks. When pushed during gaming the fan is audible but is very quiet so you would not necessarily need headphones during game play.The keyboard itself is good with a bit of play and solid feeling but no noticeable flex. Not mechanical but adequate. It is friendly to gaming and touch typing with full size keys and a nice number pad. Red LED lighting can be turned off or dimmed.The 15.6-Inch FHD TN screen has wide viewing angles, is very bright, and good color representation. As an improvement over the prior 7559 version, this sample does not have any border light leakage.Mouse pads are a sore point with many. The use of single surface pads is happening more and more, and often a source of issues. Having a work based ThinkPad, with a mostly unusable integrated pad, I always jump to a dedicated mouse. The Dell Inspirons pad is a bit better with mostly positive and separated sections for right/left buttonsalthough the offset may not appeal to all. Of course, if you are buying this laptop for gaming, you are already going to use a dedicated mouse.Sound quality is acceptable with good stereo separation, although the subwoofer is certainly not earthshaking. Strangely enough, out of the box, some diagnostic work was required and drivers had to be reinstalled due to no sound. Admirably, Windows made this simple with a quick restart.So, should you buy this laptop? Personally, for the games I play and the tasks I do, this is a great laptop for the price, albeit not perfect . You should consider what games you may play and read additional reviews regarding the suitability of the Nvidia GTX1050 for your own uses prior to jumping to any system that has similar specs. Great value and recommended.",1,0,1,2,2

This thing lasts me 8-12 hours depending on the apps I'm using and the brightness setting.The screen is a bit flimsy and not as sturdy as most laptops (as in it kinda shakes when you move it around, but not to the point where it's a flaw in my opinion.)I'm just completely in love with its design and everything about it is delightful to me.",3,3,3,2,4

1004,Worst and stupidest laptop. It doesn't let you do anything due to 4 GB memory. You cannot even save your resume or a single super light weight document. It stopped even connecting to the wifi and giving me such hard time. I wasn't able to even buy the microsoft office later and install it due to the small memory it has. I would say NEVER waste your money for this stupid product and the stupid people who made it.I cannot connect to the internet either. This is extremely frustrating and I have been having such a hard time thinking the problem was with my wifi. Until I used my friends' computers and I saw the difference. I would like to return this laptop and get a refund if no one can help me fix the wifi problem.,3,1,5,4,3

It is so portable and light, and even after a year of falling, a spill, and crumbs falling on it (college laptop), this little guy has been more reliable than my SO's $1,000 laptop. I got this when it was $179.99, and it was a steal. I would repurchase this dude again if I cannot find a battery replacement, but I hope the price comes back down to a reasonable price, $399.99 is WAY too much. Honestly, this is a perfect computer for any commuter or student in the upper years of schooling. It also allows for expandable SD card memory which is a must for a science major like myself.

The audio pops all the time and the video on my HDMI began to spaz out after one of these unrequested updates.UPDATE: upgraded to Win 10 per ASUS support suggestion and it has solved NOTHING !! It's fast but all the quirks will drive you crazy. Go find a Toshiba or Lenovo.UPDATE: ASUS support completely clueless. Tells me to format. They have no real 2nd tier knowledge to solve problems.

1011,"It doesn't look like much closed, and it has a very lightweight, plastic feel which makes me question how durable it might be if carried around and moved a lot. The lightweight construction does make it comfortable and easy to carry. It is a nice, big, full-size laptop that seems like a great model to send off to college with a responsible student. There is nothing obviously ""gamer"" looking about the unit until it is opened, and then the blue light of the neon blue keyboard looks ultra cool.The keyboard is shallow but easy to get used to, and the mousepad is not so large that it is hard to do simple things with. (I have found some gaming keyboards have touchpads so large that it is hard to copy and paste quickly, for example.)The display looks nice when watching movies in high def, and the performance when streaming high definition movies is awesome. It has plenty of power for doing graphics and video editing. Gameplay for me is smooth and even, though I typically only play roleplaying and puzzle games at full screen. The audio is a decent volume to hear if watching movies or videos, but headphones or bt speaker are needed for any decent volume to share or for an immersive experience.It does come ready for wireless network connection, but it has a wired port for LAN parties, or possibly for travel needs.It does have hdmi2, and it has a C port, so I am thinking that I might collect a video capture card to it and use it for streaming on Twitch.

1032,"As reviewed: i5-8520U, 8GB DDR4 RAM and 1TB FireCuda Hybrid DriveI am very happy with this little laptop. Now I'm a person who can't stand the current trend towards tablets and touchscreens. I'm an engineering student and have a powerful desktop setup with two 21:9 monitors and regularly use both when I'm doing homework. I'm bothered by little details and expect higher performance than the average user. I needed a laptop to bring to my internship and carry with me to classes so I started looking for a small laptop with decent specs. For me this laptop matched everything I needed at a reasonable price.The main selling points for me were:-Small portable size-1080p ips screen-Decent cpu-Traditional layout-Subjectively a nice lookOnce I got my hands on it I had some thoughts on it. I was pleasantly surprised by how rigid the chassis feels despite being plastic. When I first started using it I wasn't sure I'd like the track pad, but in use I haven't noticed it at all, it's functioned exactly how I want it to. I consider the keyboard to be good, I'd prefer a more clicky experience but I can't fault anything about it. I feel fast and accurate typing on it. I installed Linux Mint on it and it runs perfectly without tweaking. The only feature that doesn't work on Mint is the fingerprint scanner. The hybrid drive is tolerable, not as quick as an SSD but I'm not bothered by it. The speakers have a decent sound for a laptop, albeit a higher max volume would be nice.In conclusion this laptop offered everything I wanted at a reasonable price. The functionality is on par with more premium offerings and it still maintains a solid build quality and good looks. If you're looking for a traditional laptop in this size I feel comfortable recommending it. I plan on updating this review if anything happens as time goes on to change my opinion of it.",2,2,1,2,2

1034,"This is a big laptop, which has pros and cons.+: the screen is really nice, videos and simple games look great on the big screen-: it's a little too big and heavy to use it in ""tablet mode""It's convertible, which seems cool, but 15.6 inches at 4.4 lb is really too big for a tablet. I do use it in ""tent mode"" to watch videos. It's easy to get fingerprints all over the screen though when you use it in touchscreen mode.The fingerprint reader is very convenient for logging in. It starts up quickly because of the SSD. Battery life is good. It's a great laptop for general usage.The one negative is that the screen came with some air bubbles in it. It's like a line of air bubbles near the bottom of the screen, and it's actually a very noticeable flaw on an otherwise high quality screen.",3,2,3,2,2
1035,"Purchased for my son. Others had more features, but my son wanted a large screen and he was initially very happy. EXCEPT he says space bar does not work well. I wish he had let me buy him one with more RAM, more GB, SSDL --there were several available with a bit smaller screen. Had we gotten one of those, he would probably be happier. He recently told me, ""A smaller screen would be ok."" Unfortunately, as far as I know, it is too late for an exchange. I would be thrilled to purchase him a better one!",2,2,5,4,2

Its not super loud but its noticeable. I bought this to also give a real review on it and to post pictures of how it looks since no one seems to have it on youtube -.-",2,2,1,2,3

1045,"We are a gaming family. Every one of us plays video games. When my son needed a laptop for a very conservative college, I started looking for one that had to meed the following criteria.At least an i5 to handle the new wave of games that require 4 cores.At least an high 9-family NVidia GPU to handle the gamesAt least 1 T HD to hold the games and all the class workSome version of an SDD for guick booting in classIt can't be covered in red/flashing lights/HUGE logos - it needs to blend in with all the other boring college laptops for non-gamersThis Laptop met all the criteria and even exceeded the GPU requirement - thereby future-proofing if until he's in grad school. Moreover, it did that in a package that has an excellent keyboard, great screen rez and it blends in with the other mundane laptops. Too many gaming laptops look like they were designed with 13 year old boys in mind. Lots of red. Lots of lights. They scream ""I AM A GAMING LAPTOP...LOOK AT ME!!"" Instead of sending him to college with one of those, I opted to get him something that he can open in any class and get zero notice. (The only ""gaming"" thing about it - aside from the specs - is that the keyboard is backlit red. It will stay red because it literally can not be changed. And that's fine as a red keyboard is easy on the eyes in a darkened dorm room where the room-mate might be sleeping.)My son has loaded his games on it, including some very demanding FPS's and it handles all of them without any problem (very respectable FPS). There are cheaper laptops to be had, but none of them have this level of performance. I would have expected to pay another $400 for a laptop with these specs. Some of the higher-priced ones might have an i7...but I build gaming PCs and know that - unless someone is playing a game while also running a half-dozen computing intensive programs in the background - there's not much to be gained from them.I tested some of the aforementioned cheaper laptops with the 960M GPUs and they run today's games well. My concern is a few years down the road. The GPU in this buys us a few more years of use. Take a look at this if you are looking for a sub-1k gaming laptop.",1,0,5,2,2
1046,"This laptop was everything I had hoped for and it is incredibly packed with features for anywhere near the price. Since I'm a Prime member, it arrived in two days flat. Nice! The packaging and shipping was excellent, the laptop box itself is packed in its slim cardboard packing with a perfect fit and then packed in an outer box as well. Absolutely no damage, dents or bruises at all. AC Adapter and minimal documentation included (no media). There's really nothing else needed, it appears to have one of the newer kinds of battery that's internal and not user changeable, and it charges well. On the initial screens you can choose to turn OFF all the slide controls that offer to send info to Microsoft. (recommended).One thing you have to be prepared for due to Windows 10, is that as soon as you reach the place where you give it whatever means of internet connection you use - it takes over and begins the update cycle. The large 3GB Windows 10 ver 1709 takes some patience, so just let it do it's thing and give it as much as several hours. You want to make sure that it's all up to date first before you go in and tweek things. So don't begin that process until you can spare several hours, and you'll be in good shape.It came with what I'd call minimal bloatware. Some folks want that stuff, I did not. I uninstalled xbox gaming, MS Store, an eBay shortcut and several other items I had no use for. The 30-day eval of MS Office wasn't going to do me any good so I uninstalled that as well. Less than 10 minutes lost to cleanup - no problem. Looking at the add/remove programs listing in the Control Panel, you can see it comes with the usual nice collection of Acer utilities, so don't remove those. And when you do finish the installation and have it configured just the way you want, take the time to do a Windows Image backup to an external USB drive, along with a Restore DVD, that's your very best means of recovery later on if you ever crash your drive.This is a very well-made laptop and the best by far of any of the several former Acer laptops I've owned in the past. Sturdy, powerful, loaded with all the latest and fastest ports, (you have to love the 802.11ac WiFi, it's a screamer) - along with a 1TB drive, plenty of RAM and expandable to a whopping 32GB - it's a great buy and I'd heartily recommend it to anyone wanting high performance in a low-cost package. Everyone has their preferences, true - but I give this model 5 stars for Amazon's packing, shipping, and Acer's very best product line yet. And I'm an IT Professional of some 24 years, so I get my hands on some very top-dollar laptops for business. I think you'll be pleased with this one!",2,3,1,2,2

But I'm sure it hasn't changed the price much if at all. What this HP has is stability, a backlit keyboard, and a touchscreen, all of which the Lenovo didn't have. I don't store huge amounts on the computer. Most of what I want is in the cloud or on a jump drive(for backup). So I have all I need in this HP. I have actually bought lots of HPs & been happy with all of them. Since I run a small business it's easier to just format them yearly and give them to someone in the family who needs it .

I simply ignored it but already feeling anxious what that scratchy/rattly sound is. Next hour, Windows crashes, (thinking perhaps I should've stayed with Mac). After Windows did its thing to dump and restart. The keyboard started flashing. Did a couple restarts and search the net for a solution. Nothing resolved it. A bit gutted now to have bought a possibly expensive paperweight.Update: update to fix the flashing keyboard... I just did a complete reset of the laptop again and that seemed to resolve it. however, I still get the scratchy/rattly sound once in a while",3,2,2,0,3

First of all, it's ridiculous I had to pay for shipping but I can deal with that.I explained the problem in detail to support and even recorded a video of the issue. The laptop was sent back and the problem was not addressed. I contacted support and told them they did not fix the problem. I asked them what they did. They said they replaced the trackpad. I told them I had video evidence. They would not admit to this and offered to do another RMA.I agreed to send it in a second time. Again, they assured me it would be fixed. They said I would get priority support.I get it back and the trackpad doesn't click some of the time and now it's physically tilted. It's actually in worse condition. It actually took longer to get the laptop back this second time.I contact them again and asked just to get my money back. They said they cannot do this but said they would send me a replacement laptop. I agreed. This time, DAYS and DAYS go by and it's still in repair status. All they have to do is verify my laptop was received and send me a replacement I thought. I contact this nightmare of a support team and they say they are verifying my laptop has an issue. I ask to escalate the issue multiple time. I am assured it has been. I am now sitting on at least 3 days and have not heard back from a supervisor. They can't tell me who should be contacting me or when. The only thing I'm told is that the supervisor might not be in his office.I have lost countless hours and dollars having to use an old and slow laptop attempting to get things done.ASUS customer service is absolutely horrible.I have multiple ticket numbers.

1055,"I am an intense user and the Surface Laptop is the best laptop I owned so far. Upgraded it to Win 10 Pro since I need a wide variety of software on the machine for professional use (Image processing, CAD, etc.). The upgrade was free and easy. The keyboard is very precise and comfortable, allowing for fast typing. Mouse and touch screen very accurate. The display is crisp with natural colors. Processor and SSD performance is ample. Beautiful detail solutions like the power supply plug and the additional USB charging port in the power supply add to the appeal. And the design is clean, minimalist, beautiful.I hope I will have this laptop for a very long time!",0,2,3,2,4
1056,"Doing well so far. I do not see any screen bleeding. Tried getting Windows/BIOS/Nvidia drivers updated at work. Let me say that you will want to immediately remove the startup sound set in the BIOS... super annoying. I will report back on specs and performance.UPDATE:Still need to look into the BIOS issues (VT-x or RAID settings or overclocking manually), but the monitor is NOT 60hz, it is 75hz (which was awesome to find out, since ACER and everyone else keeps saying it is 60hz). Gsync does work with the monitor (once you update the BIOS). No screen bleeding or stuttering. No heat issues. No issues with Windows, except ones that Windows caused themselves. I have been playing Conan with ultimate settings and have not went over 60C. Hard drives a bit slow, but not a big issue. Only wish they were not RAID 0, especially since I have spent hours downloading updates for games via Steam. Thought I'd want the DVD drive, but now all games require online activation and updating day 1, so it doesn't really need this. Hardly any bloatware (office 365 trial and maybe 2 others). Software from ACER is great, especially Predatorsense, which allows overclocking, but the optimization software could be a bit better like AVG:PC Tuneup. I will try to keep updating this. Great buy so far! Only complaint is the locked BIOS and RAID setup at the moment. Build is solid. Keyboard is amazing, but could be recessed a bit more for comfort. Trackpad is great, but a bit sticky, as there is a bit of friction with the material they chose, which may go away after use anyway. Keyboard is zoned backlighting but looks great. Fans are quiet. I don't see what everyone was talking about when it came to the fans being noisey. WIFI is super fast. I think I may have covered all the issues I have seen reported... I think they were just one-offs. Colors display great on monitor with a good refresh rate. Power cord is shaped a bit strange, as it lies across the cd drive, due to a 90 degree turn in the cord at the computer-side plug. Sound is good enough. Oh, the symbol on the back DOES light up, along with the running stripes on the back. I dislike that my window key is disabled when the trackpad is turned off, but I understand why they did this. Just wish I had a way to turn off the backlighting at the push of a button, but there may be a way to do this that I haven't found yet(except for running off of battery). I got some Kryonaut paste (the best for novices), but I don't think I will ever need it, even with overclocking in Turbo mode. You get a little over 2-hr of web time on battery and probably more if you adjust powersaving options. KillerEthernet program is great for blocking programs from using your bandwidth. I will hopefully be able to try to break RAID, as advised per the ACER boards, and get an NVMe SSD. I guess most of the BIOS settings people are concerned about can be adjusted from Windows or software, just like this RAID setting (and overclocking and G-sync, which also required the BIOS update and VT-x, which I am told is already enabled by default) I will try to update with info about this and if it does truly allow VT-x for Virtual Machines and if I ever move away from the RAID setup. I am rambling. I would say to go ahead and buy this one! Feel free to leave questions... I will try to check back.",2,0,1,0,1
1057,"Not impressed with this product. I bought this laptop to replace my old HP desk top with Windows Vista operating system. I was sure my old PC was ready to crash. It was moving very slow, and would ""freeze up"" frequently. I expected the new laptop to move quickly and smoothly through tasks. However, it has been as slow as my 15 year old PC. It locks up/freezes up frequently, requiring a hard reboot to get going again. This is very frustrating and happens whether working on or offline, so it's not my internet connection. I also do not like the keyboard.",2,1,1,2,2

1069,"The Acer Aspire E5-576-392H is a nice budget laptop with good performance and usability. It has some good hardware features such as the 8th Generation Intel CPU, Full HD 1080 LCD screen, USB3.1 Type-C, fast 802.11ac wifi with MU-MIMO technology (up to 3 times faster speeds on MU-MIMO networks), and relatively long battery life. It is certainly fast enough for general multitasking, casual gaming, and playing videos, but it is not a gaming laptop. Bootup time to the Windows login screen is about 14 secondsAcer ranks relatively high among laptop manufacturers. LaptopMag (part of Toms Guide) rates Acer as the fourth best laptop company in 2018 with a score of 81 (out of 100). The highest rated laptop companies are Lenovo (score of 86), HP (85), Dell (82). Tied with Acer is Asus (81). Lower rated companies are Microsoft (77), Apple (72), Razer (70), MSI (67), and Samsung (67). So Acer is not significantly lower than the higher rated laptop companies. LaptopMag states that Acer knows how to provide premium features at bargain-basement prices, giving great value and pleasing aesthetics. Acer got dinged slightly for its customer support.Hardware features:* CPU: Intel 8th Generation i3-8130U Processor 2.2GHz; Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz and 4 MB SmartCache. Codename Kaby Lake-U/Y. It has 2 cores and 4 threads.* Graphics: Intel UHD Graphics 620 integrated on the CPU* Motherboard: KBL Ironman_SK V1.32* Memory: 6 GB of dual channel DDR3L SDRAM 800MHz; Max is 16 GB; slot 1 has 4 GB and slot 2 has a 2 GB stick and are easily accessible.* Screen: 15.6 inch LED backlit, full HD 1920x1080 resolution. Not a touchscreen. Viewing angle is generally good, except that the black colors in photos and videos may appear as a gray washout when the angle is more than about 45 degrees from center or the screen is tilted backward or forward.* Hard drive: 1 TB Toshiba 5,400-rpm hard drive. (Remove the compartment cover and you can swap out the drive with an M.2 SSD (solid state drive) up to 512GB).* DVD: 8X DVD Double-Layer Drive RW (writer); M-DISC enabled* Ports: Left side: Ethernet (Gigabit LAN) (RJ-45), two USB 3.0 ports, and a compact USB-C 3.1 connector, HDMI out and VGA video output connectors. Right side: a USB 2.0 port, a combo mic/headphones audio port, plus the power jack. Front: an SD or SDHC memory card slot* Camera: 720p HD web camera; takes photos at 1280x720.* Touchpad: Multi-touch trackpad. I thought it was quite good.* Wi-fi: fast 802.11ac wireless with new MU-MIMO technology (up to 3 times faster on MU-MIMO networks). It also has Dual-Band wifi at 2.4GHz and 5GHz.* Bluetooth is included* Speakers: Stereo speakers with Acer TrueHarmony offering lifelike audio* Battery: 6-cell 2800 mAh Li-ion. While Acer states that battery life may be as long as 13.5 hours, I got about 6 hours using the default settings.* Warranty: 1 yearSoftware:* Windows 10 Home edition* Microsoft Office 365, 30 day trial* Norton Security (trial)* The usual Windows 10 suspects, such as Skype, Bubble Witch, Candy Crush, Disney Magic, March of Empires, MS Solitaire, etc.Whats in the box: The laptop, charger, Acer contact info, 4 page set-up guide (in English and other languages), and a few other documentsPerfomance:For a budget laptop, performance is very good. LaptopMag states 8th Gen Core chips are between 50 and 92 percent faster than their predecessors on multi-threaded tasks. Geekbench 4.2.3 gives my Acer a single core score of 3970 and a multi-core score of 7842. Geekbench uses an Intel Core i7-6600U (6th Generation Skylake architecture) for its benchmark and the single core baseline is a score of 4000. Geekbench 4.2.3 indicates the multi-core score for the i7-6600U is 6758. Higher numbers are better. So the Geekbench indicates that my Acers i3-8130U CPU is equivalent to the i7-6600U on a single core comparison, and faster than the i7 when both CPU cores are used.For the graphics, LaptopMag states the Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics processors are suitable for some entry-level casual gaming and multimedia, including Ultra High-Definition videos.To test the multitasking capabilities, I opened 25 tabs in Firefox. I began downloading a large file. I ran Wonderfox Video Converter to convert a video to a different format. And I played a DVD movie using 5KPlayer. While all this was running I went into MS Word and began typing. There was no lag or delay as I typed text, so running all of those processes did not degrade the performance.Other comments:*USB 3.1 Type-C port supports ultra-fast data transfers. USB 3.1 more than doubles the theoretical bandwidth of the USB 3.0. USB Type-C is a new, tiny, super-fast connector for the Universal Serial Bus standard. And the USB 3.0 ports can charge your devices when the laptop is powered off.* I think the dual band wifi is great. You have to use a wifi router that supports it to get the dual band benefit. On my Netgear AC1750 router, my destops download speed using an Ethernet cable is 235 Mbps (on Spectrum). The Acer gets about 40 Mbps download speeds using the regular wifi, but gets over 150 Mbps download speeds when connected using 5G wifi. Your mileage will vary.*Windows no longer includes software to play DVD movies, so you may want to consider a free video player like 5KPlayer or VLC Media PlayerIve only had one small issue with this Acer laptop. Sometimes it does not find my desktop computer on the network. On the positive side, it survived a deep puncture hole 3 inches wide in the box during shipment.

1104,"Let me start by saying Ive been an Apple-only user until recently. I use my MacBook Pro for work and my iPad when Im traveling. Ive been traveling more and more as of late, and I find that the iPad really cant do everything I need. For the amount of time I spend on an airplane, I need a fully functional device capable of heavier lifting than the iPad. But for the amount of time I spend trekking through airports, I need a device that I can carry easily in my shoulder bag. The MacBook Pro starts to feel heavy when Im on the long march between concourses. So Ive been looking for a new computer that can replace both the iPad and the Mac, and I think Microsoft might have just created it.The Surface Laptop is very sleek. The fact that you can open it with one finger is super helpful for me as Im often on the phone while on my computer, and now I can use one hand for each. I also like that theyve made it with fabric rather than just all metal. Much nicer especially when it gets cold outside; no more cold fingers from the cold metal of my computer.What I like most though is that Microsoft has optimized this device for security. The Windows 10 S operating system is such a smart idea. How great to be able to go anywherein style!and not have to worry about my computer being safe from viruses.I have to say, Im becoming a convert.

1132,"My model is the i5-8550u + GTX 1050 model. After a week of playing around and testing various aspects of this laptop, I've come to the conclusion that while this does seem to be the best bang for the buck of convertible laptops out right now, it's really just that. Bang for buck, as opposed to best performance. I'll be evaluating this from 3 perspectives, the average laptop user [which this was not made for], the artist, and the gamer.-The Average User - 9/10 -The laptop is something else to look at. I'm not a fan of the black and red color scheme personally, but the shinny red hinges and bezel along the bottom of the laptop provide an uncommon aesthetic that while may not be the most business friendly, doesn't impose much on others either, and definitely is nice to look at from a personal setting. The aluminum chassis is very sleek looking, but is a finger print magnet. The whole device is, and I say this with caution towards the industry, ""thin and light"" enough to fit comfortably in my backpack without any real added heft. Bootup on the SSD is fast, and the whole OS maneuvering is snappy, and there's plenty of space for everything not in program files on the HDD. 8 GBs of RAM is more than enough for any everyday use scenario. The screen is more than adequate, in my opinion. It's not super bright, but bright enough to be used in a fully lit room [though outside, the sun is a bit too much for this to handle, due to gloss glare]. It has very wide viewing angles, and due to that and what seemed like more color distinction over my last device [Lenovo Flex 3], I confused it for an IPS display [apparently it's not]. Touch input is good for everyday maneuvering, being fairly accurate and fast [more on this in the Art section]. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on, with the travel distance being almost one to one with a full size keyboard [I don't remember the distance measurement], only getting squished on the right side of the keyboard, where the numpad [which I do appreciate the inclusion of] is. It has a red backlight, which is nice and bright enough, however, Acer has a 30 second timeout on the backlight, which cannot be disabled, and is very offputting and uncomfortable when using the laptop in a dark room, as I've now developed the habit of quickly hitting Ctrl before typing in order to turn on the backlight to find the homerow keys [which is doable, but more time consuming without the light staying on]. I would appreciate an Acer update to fix this, but apparently so would the rest of Acer's community. Trackpad is good, nothing to complain about, but an interesting thing worth mentioning is that it seems to have variable click sensitivity on the left and right click buttons. You can press them softly for a mushy click, or hard for a tactile one. Web browsing, typing, etc are all doable and enjoyable on this device, for the most part. Sound is not great. The speakers are advertised with Dolby Atmos, but are very underwhelming, with very little bass, and not the most enjoyable sounding treble. It's serviceable, but nothing to write home about. They also had a problem with popping slightly, but that was remedied by dropping the Realtek quality settings from 24 bit to 16 bit [no noticeable quality loss, just more consistently clear]. As a tablet (mode), the laptop is rather big and heavy at about 5 lbs, so it's not something you'd want to be standing with for a long time, but if sitting in a chair or in bed, works fine for extended use. The weight is the tradeoff you make for a dGPU. Battery life easily lasts 7 or more hours on light usage. Also worth mentioning that the laptop makes an audible beep whenever you unplug or plug it in.-The Artist - 7/10 -I have to say, I was really excited for the digital art potential of this device after my old Flex died on me, because it seemed to be the same idea, but with better internals, a bigger screen, and a numpad. However, I have to say I'm disappointed with the touchscreen performance of this laptop. I've heard that Windows Ink works great on this device, but as I did not have Ink support on my Flex, I have personal gripes with Wacom as a company so do not own a Windows Ink pen, and I use active or ""nipple"" styli to draw digitally, I am disappointed with the touch screen calibration of the device, which Windows does not allow adequate recallibration of [all you can do is adjust your pinpoint offset, not your input timing settings]. When trying to write or draw in any application that supports it [Paint, Paint.net, Medibang, Autodesk Sketchbook, etc {+my version of Photoshop does not support touch input at all}], quickly making nonlinear shapes with a stylus or your finger in a small area will often be confused for holding down your touch input and be read as an attempted right click instead of inputting the actual shape, such as how attempting to create a small set of spike or curve shapes will result in no registered input, or as a line between where you began the input and ended it. This problem cannot be fixed by Windows touch settings, but can be mitigated by touch-drawing as if you were sketching [many small lines to make a larger image, rather than continuous lines], and then smoothing the jaggedness out in a later layer. In addition, slowly trying to draw simple shapes like lines or curves will result in a shape that resembles a zig zag along the path you traced. This is a result of what seems to be lower refresh rates of touch input that seem to be present on the display, causing a smooth motion to be broken up into inaccuracies. This was not a problem in my past touch-art experiences, and is dismaying to see here. I also heard that the non-Nitro Spin 5 comes with an included Acer Ink-supported stylus, which is again, disappointing to not see here, for a higher retail price. However, since these issues can be worked around with technique adaptations, the device still gets a passing grade. You can still create art on it, and the more I do on the device, the more I adapt to it, but it's not as intuitive of an experience as I think it should be.- The Gamer - 8/10 -This is honestly not a great price to performance gaming machine, but to be fair, it's meant to be an jack of all trades, not a gaming specialty. 8 GB of RAM, while not always suitable for gaming and multitasking, was fine for anything I tested this device with, so long as I didn't leave my 30 chrome tabs open haha... Ahem. The GTX 1050, with 2 extra Gigs of VRAM dedicated to it works wonders on most things at 1080p; Medium to Max settings are enjoyable to playable on seemingly anything. The i5-8550u on the other hand... both does and doesn't work that same magic. I should say it works like a dream for the first 30-90 seconds of gaming... and then becomes a potato. The CPU is very capable, but is hindered by temperatures and Power Draw limits. It will begin a game running at the max 3.4 Ghz on all 4 cores, destroying the framerates [60+ fps] of any game I'd tried [which is admittedly not that many in one week, but they were two more demanding ones of Dark Souls 3 [many settings tested] and Final Fantasy XV [1080p average]]. However, after the aforementioned 30-90 second turbo limit, on stock settings, the CPU throttles down to about 1.1 Ghz, sometimes less, causing framerates to plummet into the unplayable territory, as if you had gone from a pseudo i7, which is what this is, to an Atom or Celeron. On these stock settings, temperatures were around 40-50 C idle, and averaged around 68-70 C under load. After using Intel XTU to undervolt -100 mV, interestingly, temperatures went up a few degrees, at 70-75 C under load, but performance increased by almost 500 Mhz, to averages of 1.4-1.5 Ghz under load. Which still isn't great, but is better, keeping games in the 30+ fps territory. However, Acer has placed a Power Draw limit on the CPU for when the GPU is active simultaneously. While on short turbo boosts, or when only putting the CPU under load, the CPU will draw about 25 W of power to reach 3.4 Ghz across all cores, stably, and at around or just below the same temps. But while the GPU is running alongside it, it will only draw a max of 10 W, which is less than the power draw it's even rated for [15 W]. This is ridiculous, because I've observed more temporary performance with no increased heat, and I haven't found a solution to it, but perhaps it's still more to do with thermals and means that the PU's could do with some thermal paste reapplication. However, I don't know Acer's warranty policy on this, so I'm avoiding it for the time being. One interesting thing to note, however, is during my FFXV test, which was ~6 hours long, performance at 1080p average settings started off in the more ""just over playable"" area of 35-45 fps, but after the laptop had been running for hours, getting uncomfortably hot to the touch all over [I was using a controller, thankfully], performance increased to about 40-55 fps on average. Still, needing to run something for hours to let the system heat up in order to get good performance isn't a valid [or really sensical] solution to an easily remediable problem. Dark Souls 3 had pretty jumpy numbers, still displaying great performance on high 1080p during turbo, but the most consistent long term playability [40-60 fps] I found was medium-high settings on 1600x900p.-Overall - 8/10 -This is far from a perfect device. It has its fair share of issues in every area, the most notable of which are cooling, keyboard lighting, and touch input, but it's made for a niche of people who need a device that can do a bit of everything. It's a good deal for the money compared to the (mostly Lenovo) competition, getting you a gaming and art capable machine with a powerful dGPU and an SSD+HDD combo, and [not offered by the non-Nitro Spin 5 models, or by many other 2-in-1s]. It gets a more-than-passing grade, but still has a lot of room for improvement in future models.",2,0,3,2,2

1141,"I got the computer almost a month ago, I figured I'd do a detailed review... I bought this as a quick replacement for my old laptop since it took a crap on me. So far it's been fine, but the keys stick A LOT. Not a big deal for me.. What's a big deal is now my mouse doesn't work because it's not compatible with Windows 10. Even had to delete it from the computer it's self. Very annoyed with that. You should buy a wireless mouse on the off chance it happens to you as well. Windows also takes most of your space, after the little bit I put on the pc I now have less than 10 gigs of use. Which is an upgrade from my old laptop, but I dislike how it's going to updates. I've used maybe 1-4 gigs all together leaving me with the 9 or so. There is a lot of unnecessary stuff, so I'd do a detailed uninstall / clean. It looks as described, the charger is easily replaceable if you need to. My last laptop had a cellphone charger-esk plug. Where as this charger is much more easily attainable. It lasts a very long time battery wise, and you only need to charge it for about 2hrs, I suggest doing that when it's about to die as your battery life may be cut short.

1166,"Having waited for this since 2016, the Samsung Chromebook Plus has comfortably lived up to astronomical expectations - replacing both my ipad and laptop and doing a better job of both. I am new to Chrome OS but I can tell you now it's going to take something special to pull me away.Pros:- Browsing is quick and light- it takes about 6 seconds to switch on and 3 seconds to log in. While this is much more than a Chromebook, it certainly isn't less than a Chromebook. (I'm also a sucker for Chrome OS keyboard shortcuts.)- Android apps: I love how well it syncs with my phone - whatsapp, wunderlist, google books, google docs, spotify, youtube.. can all be put down on one and picked up on the other without going through finnicky browser copies.- Screen: i) Aspect Ratio ii) Definition iii) Touchscreen. i) 3 x 2 is preferred for browsing - makes much more sense for web pages and far better for tablet experience - read ebooks and edit pages comfortably in portrait mode. And I don't feel it when I watch videos. ii) Screen is super crisp and really nice for watching videos and viewing pictures on. Need to see it to understand. iii) Touchscreen/trackpad combo is a winner - only one is a bit frustrating sometimes, having the functionality of both is ideal.- Battery life: Kills it. 10 hours if you try, 8 if you don't. Charges in about 2 hours.- Super light and thin (I can't even tell if it's in my bag or not), comfortably light enough to hold, and very very thin- thinner than my ipad and case!- Convertible: As well as the obvious bonuses of this, I feel not enough has been said about tucking the keys under the screen with the screen at 45 degrees and the keys like a stand on your lap- really nice for skype, videos, and really comfortable to scroll through pages. The other good thing is it can do every angle so you don't have to adjust your seating based on how the stand as I used to with an iPad, you can just tilt the screen differently and not have to hold it at the angle you want. This is also ideal when combined with how thin it is - because the screen by itself is thinner than any tablet.- No viruses at all- Stylus works really well with palm rejection, looking forward to Google Keep being improved as we go.Things other people have complained about I haven't found to be issues:- Speakers: crackling once or twice in 2 months but quickly fixed but turning the volume town or moving the laptop, nothing worse than having it near a magnet or something- Android apps: Only one I use that doesn't size properly. A bit of screen flashing once or twice, but nothing more than rebooting the app needed. Expecting this to be all good when the pro comes out in April- Processor speed: never felt slow bothered me, can't see why you'd need a pro, just close tabs / apps you're not using - easy to do when you can reopen them so quickly.- No backlit keyboard: People, it's 2017, how are you still looking at the keys? Also, are you also 15 trying to stay up without your parents knowing? The brightness from the screen is plenty for any setting I'd say, even if you can't touch-type.Who should buy this?Anyone who wants something for entertainment and personal use that's well built, portable and fast. This is the mother of all notebooks, as light as a feather without a bloated or tablet operating system, perfect for anything you'd do at home or in a coffee shop.This also works very well as a 3rd device or a laptop for kids/teenagers (especially with the stylus).Who shouldn't buy this?- Video editors - probably need a more developed operating system- People who need some special apple/microsoft only programme (eg iMessage, Garage Band or people who can only code in VBA)P.S. Good tip: I've really benefited from having a phone I can turn into a wi-fi router and a good amount of 4G internet on my contract.

1169,"I have mixed feelings about this laptop. I was excited to find a brand name gaming laptop under one grand that offered exceptional specs for my gaming needs. On paper, this laptop met those needs. With a quad core i7-7700HQ, GTX 1050Ti, 8GB DRAM, and 128GB SSD + 1TB Hard Drive, it was certainly appealing. Space for games, the next best graphics card that isn't VR ready (which I had no immediate interest in), the price is exceptional and very affordable, and it had the brand name MSI.However, the LCD screen is so noticeably terrible that is literally ruins the experience for me. I initially assumed there wouldn't be a notable difference between LED and LCD, and oh boy, was I wrong. I want to congradulate MSI on making such a terrible screen. I feel as if you went out of your way to find and produce the cheapest quality screen you could. If you're interested in buying this laptop, please take this into account. However, I am such a snob that instead of trying out or buying and keeping the Acer Helios 300 laptop, I will keep this laptop simply because ""MSI"". Also, Acer just does not inspire trust.

It also retains every and all fingerprints.Taking a step away from aesthetics, on the gaming side, I have not had ample opportunity to game hardcore, but have noticed lag when playing simple RPGs like Runescape.

Took a chance to order it online with Amazon, but wife said that she uses Lenovo computers at work, and they are fine.Pros:Came in 2 days with PrimeBoxed in a box. Then had soft styrofoam corner protectors.Works well and is quiet. It's a laptop with Windows 10, Can barely hear the hard drive. Fan is a fan, not loudTouch screen, which I likeCons:2 minutes of watching the flash Lenovo on the screen15 minutes of downloading updates ( I have DSL, which sucks)During setup, the keys pressed did not always type, which s weird. I was typing, but nothing was showing up, so had to touch the screen to retype it. Maybe it's user error, but it was when typing in my logins for emails and passwords. Didn't happen just once, but probably 5 or 6 times.Annoying: well, it's windows 10, and Cortana comes alive and starts talking you through the setup. She didn't get my wifi right, and had to enter that manually. No big deal. Also, I told it United States on setup, but it didn't ask time zone, and for some reason it was in Belgium. Another hassle, but not too bad.Overall, I would buy again, but I have only used it for a couple of hours. Seems faster than my old laptop, and it should.

It'll come to a crawl if there's a background update going on at the same time. Don't get me wrong, you can actually do almost everything except gaming if you are patient enough and don't mind some slowdowns here and there, and careful with what you run at the same time.

1211,"My first and probably last chromebook.1) Computer arrived in pretty much brand new looking finished. I easily could have mistook this for a new computer, except that it was still configured as a meeting chromebox and required Acer tech support troubleshoot the issue with me for an hour before being able to login to the computer.2) OS update allows me to use android apps on the computer. However, the two apps I use most crash every time i open them. So I'm back to accessing on them on the browser. I like my apps better, but apps don't work on this thing, despite what the OS description said. If you want to access an app or service, its done through your Chrome browser, not the androidapp.3) My biggest complaint about this computer is the keyboard. The genius who designed the keyboard put the SEARCH button directly to the left of the A key. Since there is no number pad, any experienced typer will have to reorient their typing stance from a center-left position to a dead-center position. Its extremely cumbersome using the keyboard despite its full size. Additionally putting the search button directly to the left of the A key is so annoying I'm actually considering prying the key off so I stop accidentally pressing it. If that search button wasnt in such a stupidly designed location, this would be a 3 star review.The main redeeming value of this computer, and only reason its not a 1 star review is the ease of use in terms of the Chrome OS. If you know chrome, you already know the computer. It would have been nice if the seller would have set the puter back to factory stats prior to mailing it. 1 hour of my life wasted troubleshooting that little mix up.",2,2,5,4,2

However, when I start to stream a lot of data the wifi connection is lost. The only way to get it back is to reboot. I am a network engineer by trade so I am pretty sure I know what I am doing. I contacted Samsung and they suggested the reboot method as well, but I consider that a workaround and not a solution.

It's fast, has a good battery life and runs pretty well for a $200 computer. This fits in most of the sleeves you can get for the smaller macbooks.A few problems I have found, sometimes the touchpad goes a little haywire, which has never bothered me too much, but could be irritating to some people. Another issue, the color is great, it's a very pretty muted gold, rather unsaturated, but if you're not super gentle with it like I am, the paint comes off pretty easily, and shows the black plastic underneath which isn't so cute. This could probably be fixed if you're not scared of a little spray paint.",3,1,5,4,3

1225,"The laptop has amazing power for home, work and school use but the amount of ROM (hard disk space) being only 32GB is waaay to low to use anything else than chrome and microsoft office. Usable is like 29 gigs and of those only 9 are available, so don't expect to load music, movies or anything here, have everything in SD cards or USB flash drives.The screen is just plain bad, with the blue light filter it looks waaay to yellow, but a little tinkering on the display properties and a different wallpaper helps a lot, but angles are bad as well. But, it is 1080p which is awesome at 14"" and it comes with windows set at 150% sized items so that they are not so small on screen, perfect for my grandma which is who I bought this laptop for.The graphics are intel hd 500 and it does an awesome job at driving the display and even videos at 4K on youtube. But don't expect to do any gaming on this.On the other hand, if you use teamviewer to control your PC at home like your main machine or use this as a web content consumption device like youtube or netflix it is awesome, or even to use Steam in Home streaming.Basically it is like a chromebook, but with proper windows.Pros:The price, just, it is too good for what it can do.The fact that it is 1080p.The port layout, plenty usb readers and a ethernet port on a laptop this thin are very welcome.Serves as a chromebook but with proper windows and the ability to work offline and install normal .exe files.Cons:The screen is bad in colors but fixable, but really bad at an angle.Battery life is average being a low power device should last a little more. (used in performance mode not power saver)It only has 32GB of storage which is really the only bad thing about the laptop in general because you have to be online to work with online files or to use teamviewer or to play games on it with geforce now because it can not hold more than 9 gigs worth of content and thus it should only be used for home use where you have wifi at all times or at work but work and school can fill up those 9 gigs with files and junk pretty fast.If there was a model with 128 gigs of SSD or 500gb of HDD this would be awesome in general and only the screen would be bad about it.",3,4,5,4,3

1241,"I really wanted to like this computer since it came loaded with a lot of good applications. I've worked with it for two weeks and the touchpad makes me crazy. It started out as not responsive at all and I had to hold everything down for several seconds to make it work. It got faster over time but there is still a huge lag compared to the touchpad on my 10 year old mac. On the left click side, there's a lag. But on the right click side it is too responsive so I was constantly clicking on things I did not want to click on. The curser just seemed to zoom all over the page. It was a cheap computer so maybe comparing it to a Macbook Pro touchpad is not fair - but I still expect a touch pad that doesn't make me want to scream. Not crazy about the ""Cortana' voice set up either. It took 10-15 minutes to set up what normally takes about 2-3 minutes on a Mac - part of that was the difficult touchpad. And this may be a windows issue, but I was constantly accidentally activating Cortana even though I turned her off. On the good side - I love how tight the serial ports are. No chance of them getting pulled out accidentally. I love the fact that you can drag and drop or copy like you can on all Macs. That may be the newer version of windows software, but it works very well. Came loaded with a PDF opener and many other things I normally have to download. Might be why the storage space was very limited. One other pet peeve every time I touched it, even with clean hands it left finger prints everywhere. It does boot up fast and the Edge browser works well. Very light computer as well, but feels sturdier than some others at this price range. I guess I will have to look at some of the more expensive Acers but will have to read even more reviews (than I already did) about their touchpads prior to buying. Hopefully, if I spend a little more I will get a touchpad that works much better and more storage. Maybe that's a higher level Acer, but we shall see.

1251,"Got this as workstation and as a gaming device, to replace my now aging desktop pc. I could have updated the CPU, motherboard, memory and video card, and get another desktop, but just the video cards nowadays cost about 1200 dollars; so the thing was not feasible, and went for a laptop; in the meantime that prices go back to normal.The whole thing is solid; heavy; and give you a great feel of being resilient when you use it. The trackpad is decently sized and works fine; although it is not super precise, but I use the laptop mostly as desktop replacement, connected to wireless mouse and keyboard.The LCD screen is pretty nice and bright; refresh rate is great; and works fine for most of the activities; but I have the laptop connected to a bigger monitor on my desk, so I don't use it all the time. Colors are pretty bright and vivid; took a bit to calibrate it but then you can let it be and enjoy it.The keyboard is awesome; I feel very comfortable typing on it; and the resistance and spacing of the keys is perfect for me (I have big hands); I still make mistakes because the layout of the keyboard on the right side is not the same as a standard PC keyboard; but once you remember that the delete key is right on top of the backspace, and that the enter key is not as big as it was, then it is a breeze. Plus it has a ton of light settings; not a fan of flashy ones, but the red hue is quite nice.CPU and GPU works great; got some awesome results from 3dsmax, Visual Studio and other Adobe apps like Photoshop and Dimension; which made me very happy, since the main usage of this computer is portable graphic workstation. Unity works great too, and with 16 GB of RAM, you have plenty to run concurrent and memory-intensive apps.SSD is small; and it is weird since it is a raid made of 2x128 GB M2 drive; but it works fast and it is fine for me. The computer has a 1 TB mechanical drive, which won't win any contest for speed, but it is reliable and awesome to have inside the computer, to store large amount of data.The computer comes with a DVD combo drive, which can be swapped for an extra fan; I did ditch both and got an extra caddy to put an extra SATA SSD drive; and the process was painless. Now I have 2 TB of storage plus the 256 GB of system drive, and all without opening the laptop or buy external enclosures.Sound is OK; I didn't buy it for that, the internal audio card works as expected with headphones; and the internal speakers are quite loud and nice to listen to; but for movie watching, use your headphones.The fan is not that loud; not sure where you live, but in my office room, with everything else going on, I can't hear it at all, even when it is full throttle. I never got the laptop very hot, neither when playing games nor rendering in 3dsmax or working in Unity; so I guess I was lucky with the thermal compound job they did at the factory.Games run fast here; got Witcher 3 at max details and it runs smooth as silk; same for other games that are very demanding, like Tomb Raider. The scores for 3dmark are a bit lower than a desktop overclocked 1070 with an i7 8th gen; due to the fact that the laptop versions are usually clocked lower for power and heat management issues, but I won't loose my sleep for few frames lost. If you are a purist, get a desktop computer.Battery life is a joke, but this is a desktop replacement. The main issue is the lack of energy saving process, which would switch to the Intel onboard GPU, but this does not happen; the 1070 is always on and this means that the battery goes down fast (about 2.5 hours of usage, 50m if rendering). Plugged in, no problem, but if you plan to move around with this beast in tow; keep in mind that you need to be close to a plug most of the time (although in this case, you would get an ultra light model).Software onboard was not super intrusive; I did remove the extras I do not need; and left the Acer app, that is great for backup, restore and overall managing the computer drivers and get the info like serial number and such. W10 works just fine.It has 4 USB3 ports on the sides, and 1 USB-C Thunderbolt; so if you plan to use an external GPU one day, you can do so. Future proof is great.The other ports are the power connector; a SD card reader (always welcome to avoid to use a dongle), and a display port (full port, thank God) and a HDMI port, with the LAN port to guarantee connectivity at top speed. It has also a mic and headphone jack, which are also great.VR works great on this computer; the Rift runs smooth and nicely; setup was easy and also using external monitors works great (got an ultra-wide screen connected to it).In conclusion; great specs, decent price for what you get, and VR ready; perfect as game machine and as workstation; can't really complain much about anything.",2,0,1,0,1

1259,"So, this was the worst purchase I've made in a long time. This is the 3rd refurbished PC I've bought, the 1st I've ever purchased from Amazon. When I received it I had 5 days to customize it and transfer all of my file from my older laptop to give that one to my daughter for her birthday, and use this one as my new laptop.First, when I turned the laptop on, it wouldn't boot. It said there was no boot device found. Big ""UH OH!"" for me. So then I did some diagnostics and found that the hard drive was there, with absolutely nothing on it. So I thought... ok, I'll access the restore partition that all Dell's have and restore it to the original factory OS. Well... no partition could be accessed. So I knew there was an even bigger problem going on.I then created a partition-restore image to use to repair the damaged partition and restore factory images. Well.... the restore partition was so corrupt that it could not be repaired.So then I called Dell and explained the issue. They couldn't believe someone would sell me a ""Refurbished PC"" claiming to be in good order and with Windows 10 installed on it, and have it be so horrible. They referred to it as a paperweight. I even sent them the link to the item I purchased and they laughed at what I had sent to me. A complete inoperable piece of junk.I asked if they could send me a restore disk and they said that I had to realize that all drivers would be gone and a disc would not be read. But I could program a USB to restore the PC to original images as long as the computer would allow itself to be repaired.It took me 12 hours to get Windows 7 on the laptop, and an additional 5 hours repairing and restoring drivers to get it to work even semi-well.I did not have time to send the laptop back and wait for a better one (hopefully) to show up. My daughter's birthday was coming.And now that the laptop is working well because I did what the seller should have done in the first place, I'm not sending it back. They SHOULD be paying me for the technical work I did though.I am SO irritated at this purchase.This definitely shows me though that NO ONE is checking to make sure the refurbished PC's actually work. Just that they power on.",2,2,3,4,3

1262,"Yes it's fast with some programs but this computer lags every 10 seconds, if you have multiple windows open. Despite being quad core it can't handle multiple windows, and I'm talking 2 or 3... I can't switch back from powerpoint to my pdf reader without lagging or freezing for 2-3 seconds. Its getting tiresome. I got this laptop for processing videos, if you're just using video editing software it works fine. But if you need to get files online it will lag while switching screen. The speaker on this computer is TERRIBLE, it breaks up if it's too loud, almost like mechanical vibration sound.I rarely give out bad review because I generally read review before I buy them, but this time I got shafted. I'm considering returning it but it has I already installed all the softwares and its a hassle. I'm writing this because I'm working on my school work and it keeps lagging, I think it's because I'm listening to music while I'm searching online. This compute can't even handle that. i can't write anymore, because it already lagged billion times.TLDR: 1. speaker really bad, like really really. 2. This quadcore doesn't mean anything, can't even handle 2 chrome windows opened. 3.

All was well until the large new update to windows 10 from Microsoft appeared. The 32 gig hard drive is too small. After several update that preceded the very large update that came in Dec or Jan there is literally no space left. The new large update can't install. I've tried to stop it from attempting to install,with help from a Microsoft tech support person, but it continues to try and fail. This computer is useless with the amount of space left even with removing almost every App possible. It should not be sold to anyone with out letting them know that this problem exists. When I bought it the problem didn't exist, but by now everyone should be aware of it. Don't buy this computer. There is no fix. I bought a hard drive that would take the place of the WiFi card only to find that my model had changed the connection type and I couldn't use it. I am stuck with a computer with an operating system that can't update and that has no space left on the hard drive.",2,2,5,4,6

However, no matter how great the specs are and how responsive it is, if you can't see the screen , it is useless. I called tech support for Lenovo a couple of times with no success. First tech tried to repair it with no success, and the second tech just said return it because that's the way the screens on these laptops are designed. It is so reflective that it is a serious strain to work for more than a few minutes in a lite room and it cannot be seen at all in sunlight.",3,2,3,2,2

1292,"Let me start off by saying this laptop is great. it's very cheap compared to other flipbooks which is nice, and its specs aren't bad considering. It's fast enough to handle normal internet browsing, and of course any office/ school work, its touch screen is great and useful, and it's nice, light, and sleek. the one thing that could be better is the pen. if you're drawing with it you may have difficulties. It regularly will think the pen is not touching the screen for a fraction of a second, so if you hit ctrl+z it will only remove part of what you drew, sometimes this makes gaps in lines aswell. you'll have to press harder than you might be comfortable with and i havent' see na way to increase pen sensitivity just through windows ink or through pen and touch settings. This laptop only has 2 USB ports, a C type and a microUSB type, so you will likely need an adapter. and the microUSB is upsidown for some reason, which is odd. lastly if the screen is free standing, AKA not stood upsidedown like the mail thumbnail or made to look like a tablet, the screen is a bit wobbly, which is fine for touch input, but not for the pen.Overall the cons sound worse than they are, this is a great laptop, it could just use some quality of life improvements aswell as a more functional penPros affordable plenty fast for academic/office work/lightweight drawing software sleek and portable touch screen works great touch keyboard is very responsive all around a good experienceCons pen sensitivity could work better only 2 USB ports, neither of which are the traditional USB-A type you will probably need adapters screen is a little wobbly when using pen in 2 of 4 (or more?) possible positions",3,2,5,4,3
1293,"We bought this to replace our 5 year old Dell that was starting to have connection issues. We really only needed a ""family"" computer to surf the internet and transfer pictures from our cameras/phones onto an external hard drive. For this purpose, the computer works great. It's fast enough with the 4GB of RAM to transfer the photos & videos via USB 3.0 without taking a lot of time. It's small enough that we just keep it on our kitchen counter so we can have access to it whenever we want. I also like that it has bluetooth pre-installed, that way we can use a bluetooth mouse without needing to use one of the USB ports for a wireless dongle. It leaves one of the USB ports free for a flash drive. The only thing I wish it did have was a full size SD card reader. It comes with a micro SD card reader, but our DSLR cameras have full size SD Cards, so we need to buy new micro SD cards with an adapter for our cameras, or a USB / SD Card adapter for the computer. We chose the second route since the adapter is cheaper than buying new micro SD cards. It's not a big deal, but I took off one star for it.",3,1,5,4,3
1294,"I bought this computer last month as a replacement for my Dell, and so far it's been great. It runs my games perfectly, and the speed is incredible. My only complaints involve the fan.

I'm a little concerned about it overheating, but after a few minutes it starts to cool down. Otherwise, a great computer for a great price.",2,0,1,0,2

1298,"This is a very lightweight notebook computer, running Windows 10, at a very, very good price. Only two problems. Although I really like having a solid state drive for quick startup, the size of 32 gigs is limiting. With a few basic programs and a greatly reduced dropbox size, there's no working room for Windows updates, even with a 1 TB external drive temporarily connected. I'd have to remove my dropbox files to allow an update, and it just gets to be too much trouble. I'm finding out, though, that I can get along just fine with the installed version of Windows 10, so I'm giving up on big updates. Two, I have some concern about the on-off process. There have been a few occasions when the computer shut off (I usually leave it on at home, but when traveling I shut it down) and was very difficult to turn back on. I suspect a mechanical weakness in the switch, because the last time it happened I removed the back and poked around, then put it back on and it started up. Perhaps it sometimes needs a gentle nudge to get it fired up.",3,1,5,4,3

1302,"First off, I am an admitted IT Geek. I have a computer science degree and have spent my entire career working in IT on everything from mainframes to wearable computers. I really know computers inside and out. I want to provide some perspective about the Chromebook by a person who spends 10-12 hours on some type of computing device every day.So why would I ever buy a device like this? Well, I ordered the Chromebook to evaluate it for my parents. They are not tech savvy at all. They have a Kindle Fire and an iPad, but when they do write e-mails and want to do other tasks, the pads are just not enough. They are computer users and media consumption people. What I found out during my work with the Chromebook is that it is the right computer for me too. Now, off to the review...First off the Google Chromebook is computer unlike anything coming from the minds of Apple or Microsoft. Something on the surface that an IT Geek like me probably wouldn't like. It doesn't have a full-blown operating system like OSX nor is it a mobile platform like Android. It is something in between, it is ChromeOS. It is very fast, very reliable, and is perfect for doing your everyday tasks. If you mostly read e-mail, write notes, run spreadsheets, develop presentations, chat, Facebook, and surf, you should read on.The Samsung Chromebook is very sleek, thin, and light. It is somewhat similar in form to a Macbook Air, but it's also close to a number of the new Ultrabooks. The feel in hand is very solid and doesn't seem like a $249 computer. The keyboard is very good; very solid feel and great action. If you type quickly (100+ wpm), you'll be happy to know this keyboard can keep up with you. The only better keyboard I've used in recent memory is the Air, but it's not far off.When you open the box and lift the lid it automatically starts up in under 10 seconds. This is not coming up from sleep mode. That's its boot time from a cold start. The setup process is as painless as it can be. Attach it to your wireless network and if you have a gmail account, just login and you are done. I up and reading e-mail in my account in less than 5 minutes. The last out of the box Windows experience took nearly an hour before I was through all of the setup questions, patches, and add-ons.Now that you are logged in, the simplicity of the system reveals itself. Effectively the entire Chromebook is a dedicated Chrome browser. Almost everything you do is in a Chrome browser window. There are applications included and that can be installed, but they all run inside of the Chrome framework. It is a new way to think about computing. And boy is it fast.About the speed: Wow is the best way to describe it. I dare you to find a browser that is as responsive as the Chrome broswer on ChromeOS. All running on a tiny little ARM processor. This tiny little ARM processor is what gives the Chromebook its 7+ hour run time on a single charge. In practice a lot of this depends on what you are doing. If you want to stream 7 hours of YouTube videos, you're probably going to be disappointed, but for practical all-day off the charger use, I'm seeing that performance easily. It also charges like lightening, so if you throw it on the charger for an hour at lunch, you won't need to worry about it into the evening.Back to why I am keeping the Samsung Chromebook. The device does what I need to do 95% of the time during my work day and 99% for the rest of my life. All of this in a very sleek, inexpensive, and portable package. I still have my work computer, a Lenovo i7 based monster, but it is huge, heavy, and doesn't have nearly the battery life or portability of the Chromebook. I now leave that laptop in the docking station on my desk and carry around the Chromebook and that is the computer I take home. I suppose if I was still spending the majority of my time writing C# I would need a different tool, but the Chromebook is the right tool for me.Pros and Cons?This introduces an interesting point of view. What can we really compare the Chromebook to? There is nothing else that is in it's class, so I guess I'll focus primarily on functionality.Pros:-Inexpensive (I didn't say cheap)-Light-Fast-All Google-Centric (this can also be a Con)-Very simple to setup and use-Long battery life-Good build quality-Good keyboard-Good library of add-on applications (yes, another app store)-Everything for one price (Hardware, Operating System, Storage, Office Applications)Cons:-Not a full-blown operating system-Doesn't run Mac, iOS, Windows, or Android applications...none of them, it can't-All Google-Centric (this can also be a Pro)-Some apps you know and love aren't available yet, maybe never (Netflix is one)-Not as mainstream as either full-blown computer platforms or mobile platformsI gave the Samsung Chromebook 4 stars because it's really good, but not perfect. Bottom line, this is a new device that lives somewhere between tablets and full-blown traditional computers. It is a great consumption device with a full keyboard for doing some serious work (documents, spreadsheets, presentations, e-mail, and web-based applications). I recommend that you give it a shot, I think you'll really like it.",3,3,5,5,6

Ultimately there came a time when the laptop shut off with no LEDs turning on and the laptop would not power-on no matter what. I had to FedEX ship my product to their Houston site after making a long customer delivery call. I got back my laptop in a week (with the motherboard replaced).

1331,"This laptop worked great at first but slowly degraded over time. If you close the screen, there is no clearance between the screen and the keyboard; this creates marks on the screen that cannot be removed. The computer is also prone to randomly shutting down which makes it heavily inconvenient for nearly any prolonged use; at first I thought it was related to overheating when I gamed on it, but even using Chrome has caused the computer to shutdown after a few minutes of use. The computer also has issues with running multiple programs at once and will freeze, which is unexpected since it's a quad-core. Of course, this all started happening after I installed new drivers for all the components though the device manager, so perhaps it's an unfair judgement that might just be an issue with a bad driver installation.Update: Installed latest drivers, installed latest bios, installed Windows 10 again. Keep getting ""thread stuck in driver"". Various people have issues with this laptop and Lenovo blamed the operating system and refused to service it in warranty unless I proved it was the hardware, but I am not a computer technician.

After coming from a computer that ran on the lowest settings at 20 fps, this is amazing.The fan is an amazing detail on it. It'll cool the computer down immediately. So t hats a huge plus.

I have plugged and unplugged but to no avail.I will attempt to return it as I am out of the US right now.It is quite disappointing.

1345,"I'm a student. I need something to carry around that I won't worry about losing, breaking, or someone stealing. I won't bring my Apple laptop to school due to theft increases lately. On that note, I wanted something for web browsing, typing papers in the library egg chairs and had a keyboard/trackpad combo. I found it.This is not for a poweruser. Don't fool yourselves, people. It's a tablet on steroids. Get that through your head when you purchase and use it. If you have any other expectations like some of the reviewers, well, you're honestly not the target audience. It's meant to be light and cost affordable. Sure, the screen isn't high resolution and it lacks expandable RAM and HD space. That's NOT what this computer is.I've had the computer for a few days now and I love it. It's not super fast by any means; however, it gets the job done in regards to web browsing, finding papers for literature reviews and listening to rdio or Pandora. That's what I need this for. And most likely the average consumer. Face it, most college students buy $1000 Macbooks to look cool. For what? To facebook, stream music, and browse the web. Most people who do photo editing buy the 15"" models with maxed out specs (like me). I don't want to bring that to campus. That's too much money to be slinging in my bag to just browse the web.So, let me be clear. This laptop is excellent. The build quality is amazing for the price. Build quality is great of which I was surprised. The keyboard reminds me of the Macbook and the track-pad keeps up with my fast paced motions quite well. It's light and I can have four to five tabs open running different processes at ease. It does like to stutter when I do multiple things with a video running though. Expected for a tablet processor though. It keeps cool and charged for a days use. The front camera is great for chatting.I will admit, this little computer will replace your daily use computer you lug around currently. I used the Chrome Remote Desktop today on campus and was amazed at the speed and ease. I was using my Macbook at home on campus without any hiccups like I experience with Logmein or those other clients. Accessing the 100GB of free storage was as simple as clicking a link. My music, documents and life are on the cloud. I can access them with ease. Printing is no problem for me, either.This little beast will surprise you. Although, please, don't expect the world from this laptop. It's $250, folks.P.S. I typed this from the Chromebook. No problems handling my typing speed. And ask questions if you need them answered.UPDATE 11/24:I've been using this for a good while now and I haven't had any regrets. The computer does what I need, when I want and I only miss running Netflix at school. That's ok though, I have other avenues for watching movies. They do plan on updating and that's a problem with Netflix, not Google. Printing is simple as it seems to be a very common question. To clicks on your computer and you're done. They have been updating the OS and the Chromebook is acting a little better now. Overall, I'm still loving it. Just remember, it's NOT for everyone.UPDATE 02/06/13:I love this computer. It is all I use around campus and for class lectures. I barely use Microsoft Office for my notes or spreadsheets in class. Google Drive and their office version is just awesome. If you do a lot of team-based activities, please, just use Google Drive. Keep your documents available to you at all times and collaboration is simple. It has made my life much easier. Just thought I'd let you all know.UPDATE 04/11/13:Netflix now works!UPDATE 07/10/13:Now that the school season is upon us, I thought I would go ahead and write an update of my handy-dandy little Chromebook. Let's just say, it's still alive and working. Drops, falls, and tosses across the couch and slides across the table this little tabcom is doing well. Software wise, Google has been working at it and getting all the bugs out of the system to provide an even more fluid experience. I love having the ability to use Google Print from ANYWHERE I am and have it waiting for me when I need it. Everything syncs up across platforms and this has really come in hand during projects. Just try the Google Docs as a team compared to Word with Review and you won't go back when doing initial collaboration. Battery is still holding up to 8-10 hours (I know, right)- that's with smart use of the brightness. I honestly don't know what else to say. It works and is the perfect complement for my Macbook that is collecting dust at home. The Macbook is used via my Google Remote Connection and it's just wonderful. No lag or anything like I've had with LogMeIn and the other one. And like always, ask questions if you have them. And I almost forgot to add that Spotify works in the browser just as well as the PC version. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon streaming does work contrary to the other review posted saying the opposite. Cheers!FINAL UPDATE:The Chromebook is an excellent computer for those looking for something light. It won't do everything a full laptop will do and there are privacy concerns of the all-mighty Google. The question to ask yourself though is if you are really secure online? You can get a better laptop as some commentators have stated and that is very true. You can get a nice, heavy computer to carry around and worry about. This Chromebook offers you peace of mind that you can throw it around and not worry about it being stolen (as long as you have a good password on your Google account). It works for me and I'm sure it works for the MAJORITY of others. I've had it for nearly a year and it is only getting faster, not slower. I hope you will take the time to see if it works for you. If not, we live in a world full of other gadgets and tools to fit our lives. I will be removing myself from the comments as there has been a strong output of support from other owners. Live long and prosper!",3,3,5,5,6

1370,"****UPDATE AFTER 5 MONTHS OF USE****I still really like this laptop, but a few issues have arisen that I wanted to mention. First, the laptop shuts off at 6% battery, not when it gets down to 0%, and then once it shuts off, I have to wait about 2-3 minutes after plugging it in for it to boot up. So that's really annoying, especially if I'm in the middle of something. Also, inexplicably, the brightness keys stopped working. These are not huge issues, but little annoyances on a laptop that's still quite new.*****Original Review Follows****I have been using this laptop for about a month now and I absolutely LOVE it. Its my first Windows laptop in a long time---Ive been using Macs for quite a while---and this is really fantastic and feels like a big upgrade over my Macbook Pro.There are so many things I love about it, so Im just going to go through them. The battery life is excellent. Its very thin and light and sleek; basically its visually beautiful. I adore the touchscreen---I thought it was going to be kind of gimmicky but its super responsive and a nice feature. The speakers are amazing, and thats probably where I see the most notable difference between this computer and my Macbook---the speakers and sound is just ridiculously good. Oh, and the facial recognition for login is a neat feature.The ports are decent; I personally find the lack of an HDMI port a little annoying but that might not be an issue for most people. Thats actually the only real negative for me, so if thats not an issue for you, you might not have any negatives.I have to admit that having used a Mac for so long, I was a little worried about how I would find the Windows OS, but I found it really easy to pick up, and in just a few weeks I feel totally used to it. This computer is fast, responsive, and instinctive.I absolutely love this laptop and have no regrets for giving up my Macbook for it. Love, love, love it.",0,2,3,2,4
1371,I love the slim & light weight design. It's very easy to take on the go. ,2,4,5,4,5
1372,"The first one I ordered made horrible squeaking electrical noises from inside the chasis, which got louder when the laptop was working harder. No, it was not fan noise, it was electrical noise (coil whine I believe) and very noticeable in a quiet room. Returned this one and ordered a second one - hopefully it will not be defective - I'll update my review when I receive it.Other than the electrical noise defect I am very excited about this laptop. I also have the ASUS UX330UA which is very nice, and compared to that one the UX430UA is slightly heavier and slightly thicker, almost unnoticeable. Feels very solid holding it. Both keyboards unfortunately place the power button where the ""delete"" key should traditionally be, so I've made the mistake of turning off my machine accidentally while deleting photos... watch out for that. Keys feel great to type on, and backlight is super helpful.***UPDATE 12-7-2017I received my 2nd unit today after returning the 1st one, and IT HAS THE SAME ISSUE ONLY LOUDER & WORSE. Very noticeable squeaking electronic noises form the chasis, almost like it has one of those loud old spinning disk hard drives (which it does not since it is an SSD). SO DISAPPOINTING! I don't know if I can bare to give it a 3rd try, but it's hard to find these same specs for the price anywhere else.CAN THE SELLER PLEASE COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE AND HELP ME OUT?*****UPDATE 2-26-2018I decided to order a 3RD unit but this time I went for a slightly different model (the one with the 7th gen processor and the graphics card UX430UQ) and the coil whine problem is gone! Well, mostly - it is unnoticeable but if I hold my ear to the upper left corner I can maybe faintly hear it when it is working hard. Can't even hear it at a normal usage distance with it on my lap. So I'm keeping this one, BUT before you run off and buy the UX430UQ note that this model does not have as good battery life as the UX430UA due to the graphics card. I'm getting maybe 5-6hrs with light usage, I was hoping for better. I wish I could have bought the UA model without graphics and better battery life but I just couldn't stand the coil whine.The model I bought : https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072WK2PVP/ref=twister_B077BNJHVJ?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1",3,2,2,0,3

1382,here are two no go's for me:1.) No replaceable battery. Battery is glued and the device is some sort of welded together. You cant not open it without damaging the device.2.) The SSD is soldered (=not removable). this means data is not recoverable if you damage the device or if something other than the SSD fails.If you can live with this it is a decent device.,1,2,3,2,4
1383,"I got this laptop from Costco about 3 months ago. Performance wise, this laptop is a killer for the price (I got mine for $649). Even though I have the lower power 1050 (not 1050 Ti) version, it still gets 1080p 60+fps on modern games, with high (but usually not ultra) graphics settings. Concerns about thermal throttling are mostly unfounded. Even while playing games that max out my computer's performance, temperatures never go above about 80C (hot but not enough to damage hardware) and I don't experience FPS drops, but it does get loud and warm to the touch.Its build quality feels like a typical $600-$700 laptop - sturdy but not premium. There isn't too much flexing and no creaking, but I've had some subtle clicking noises from the touchpad that sound like something loose. Those are gone now. The plastic on the top gets scratched easily, and the entire laptop attracts fingerprints. The keyboard's individual keys don't feel very nice, but surprisingly gave a very nice typing experience. It gets 6 hours of battery of very light usage, 4 hours of heavier browsing. I haven't tried playing games on battery. The screen is not really bright enough to use near direct sunlight, but does fine in the shade. Turn the brightness down for much better battery life. The screen's colors are okay, just a cheap IPS screen.The laptop comes with lots of bloatware from the factory. What I found most annoying was that the power button was controlled by Acer's software. Once I uninstalled all of it, the power button only can shut down and turn on the computer. There is a keyboard shortcut to sleep, though. The computer also has no physical indication of whether Caps Lock is on, that was also shown by the bloatware.Other stuff: webcam is average, speakers are average, keyboard lighting is nice, has 3 usb and 1 usb-c (no thunderbolt) plus RJ45 ethernet and headset jack, nice angled power connector, is not too thick or heavy. Mine didn't come with a cable to upgrade the hard drive. 256GB is enough for general usage, but you can't install large games.Overall, though, this is a great laptop in the ""value gaming laptop"" market, and well worth your money.",2,0,3,2,2

1391,"As a straight purchase, upgrade to the SSD version as the HD version performs poorly with a lot of lag just the Win10 environment. Lag was down right annoying in applications.The Bad:I had purchased this based on the empty m.2 SSD slot for an extra drive; however, the m.2 slot is not supported with the BIOS that ASUS has loaded on the MB. When I contact ASUS, I got mixed results. But when it was clear to them I was wanting to use the m.2 slot, it became all 'please use a professional certified upgrader', etc. Further help was cut off. This is why I'm docking 2-stars.Based on tips online and some off-the-script guidance from ASUS, I tried reinstalling Win10 on the HD with no noticable improvment. Ultimately ended up installing a 2.5"" SSD and reinstalling Win10 as it was past the return period and all the troubleshooting I had done pretty much blocked a return anyways.The Good:Empty memory slot makes it easy to double RAM to 16GB. And I had no issues with RAM upgrade.ASUS support was good on helping with a track pad issue (BIOS update) and which 2.5"" SSD's could be installed.With the new 2.5"" SSD and Win10 freshly installed, this is a great laptop. Lag begone! No lag issues in O365, and I am even running Lightroom without issues. Battery life is good. Web-browsing and O365 apps seem to get 4-6 hours per charge. LR burned through a charge in <2 hours, but it's LR, right? No issues with heat build up. Unit runs cool, even in LR. I am going to try loading up a few games to see how they run.This unit is not bulky due to the thin bezel around the screen. It feels more like a 14"" computer, but the screen view is 'huge'. The graphics look nice for a laptop and definitely top-notch in this price range. The case feels a little flimsy. Opening things up, it is clear there is not much stiffening material in the case/shell. But I am not hard on my electronics (I don't expect them to survive a two-story drop unharmed). I do not expect to have issues beyond normal wear. The weight is light enought that I would compare it to the Mac Airbook it is replacing (yes, I went Apple for a bit, but I'm back folks!). The small charger unit is a bonus too. This will not take up much room in any bag.Final Word:OK, master plan to get a powerhouse laptop for less than $1000 was not totally realized.

So I bought this new ASUS VivoBook for me and my employee.So far so good. The fingerprint reader might be too sensitive (~miss reading my finger about 40% of the time). In addition, the acoustic does not perform better than UL50V. But I did not expect too much from those two aspects at the beginning. Other than those, me and my employee are pretty satisfied with this laptop. Can't be wrong with a solid-built laptop if your budget is about $600.",1,4,1,2,2

1403,"Unfortunately I had to return this laptop. Here's why:The machine I received will not charge the battery.The first day I received it, I charged it all day.After more than 8 hours of charging, I unplugged it, and took it into my den to use while I watched TV. I noticed that the battery indicated 100% charge several hours after I had unplugged it, and did not give that much thought except to think wow, this machine has a pretty strong battery.Sometime after that, the machine suddenly died.I plugged it in, and the next morning noticed that it had not charged, and the battery icon had an ""X"" in it. Clicking on the battery icon, it showed ""Battery not Present"". Picture of this attached. Mind you, I had only received the laptop the day before this.I contacted ASUS by chat, and they had me do some stuff -- screen shot of what I did is attached. This allowed the battery to charge back up, but exactly the same thing happened again, that is, once the battery ran down, the battery would not charge, and the battery indicated 100% until it ran down.I contacted ASUS again, and this time they had me restore the OS using Windows Recovery - Restore this PC. This again allowed the battery to charge, but again it indicated 100% until it ran down, then indicated the battery was not present and will not charge.As long as the laptop is connected to the power supply, it works fine. Very fast, good display, etc.Obviously there is something wrong with it, so I returned it.0 stars for the laptop, but ASUS service was easy to get in touch with and did what they could. And Amazon made the return very easy.0 stars for Amazon packing. They just put the box the laptop came in into another box with no packing material except a piece of crumpled up paper. The box the laptop in was free to bounce around in this box, although it was not damaged that I could see. I have to wonder if the packing at the Amazon fulfillment center is completely done by robots? Perhaps the time and money saved is greater than than the shipping damage.",2,0,1,2,1

1422,"I was a little nervous ordering this laptop for school (college) but once I received it and spent some time with it I have come to really like it. So, to help you make up your mind:Pros-I love the compact size and light weight. It adds no mass to my already heavy backpack.The screen quality is surprisingly good. I was reading reviews about crappy screen quality, so imagine my shock when I open the screen and it's like looking at a mini hdtv. It has a bit of that gameboy color effect, but all laptops do.This little thing is really speedy. As another user suggested, I installed ghostey(sp?) And another program to help internet security/speed and I can have 2 browsers open with tons of tabs and it can handle it's own.It can run Minecraft. I was not expecting that, but it was a very pleasant surprise.The color is really pretty. It's not a bold gold. When I took it out of the box I thought they had sent me a silver one. Once my eyes adjusted I noticed it was a very pretty light gold. Almost rose gold.It has a microSD port, so you're not limited to the Gigs it comes with.Cons-I don't know if it's Windows 10 (this is my first time with windows 10) or the laptop, but updates take a long while. So much so that the first time I thought it was broken.Due to the aforementioned situation I had to get in contact with the online ASUS customer service. I was not impressed.I miss a full sized keyboard with the numbers pad, but I don't think newer laptops use them anyways? So it's not a huge loss.All in all, I really like this little guy. Hopefully that helps you decide whether or not you want to buy it.",3,1,5,4,3
1423,"It is a very good mini PC. Fast for web browsing and office operations. It fits my need perfectly, I wanted a light weight device to go meetings and vacations. It is surprisingly quality built with good battery life. Only thing I don't like is that its power plug is not the standard round type, which is bad for an external power pack. I plan to buy another one as spare, before our racist president slaps a 45% tax on imports from China.",3,1,5,4,3
1424,"Note: I bought this at Best Buy for the same sale price. Now that I have to pay sales tax in Florida on Amazon purchases, the 7% incentive to buy online is gone. Same price - immediate gratification, easier return. Best Buy it was.I have been following 2-in-1 laptops for the last 6 months without being able to make a decision. I looked at high end Windows (HP Spectre, the Acer models, the Lenovo models, the Dell models, etc). Based on review, I discarded the low end models. I have had a Chromebook FLIP about a year and it is okay, but too small. I read the reviews on the Samsung Chromebook Plus and Pro and decided to wait for the Pro. I finally gave up waiting because there was still no release date and there was a sale on of the Plus.I am completely satisfied with this computer. I stream easily with a clear image (great graphics) with only a very occasional flutter in the motion. I can multitask without it bogging down. Also, I found the magic command to show all of the Chromebook secret commands: control-alt-/ (or ? if that is easier to remember). Yes, there is a delete letter key, as well as delete word, screen shots, partial screen shots, and a hundred other commands that make the Chromebook more functional than Windows, rather that less. And you can activate the F top row keys with a keyboard settings switch. I have had no problems switching into and out of tablet mode. And the Android apps have been for the most part running flawlessly.This is more functional that a Ipad and much more value for the money that a WIndows computer or a Macbook. For example, I am learning Spanish and I can use a Chrome extension to translate words by hovering over them or tapping, even in the tablet mode. More enjoyable, I can use Lyrics Here and Transover to translate the lyrics of Spanish songs while listening to them on Spotify. I now can enjoy listening to Cafe Tecvba and La Oreja de van Gogh.Microsoft is coming out with their version of a Chromebook with a Windows browser. But it will never had the extension base and the Android App base that the Chromebook does (I am sure it will not run Chrome). I don't know if the Samsung Chrmoebook Pro is better than this, but for the price I got this there is nothing better at twice the price than this Plus.",2,4,5,4,5

1426,"After updating Windows and uninstalling some junk, I was able to get 15GB free space left before I install anymore apps. I then put in a 128GB USB 3.0 Samsung Flash Drive Fit, which would have been invisible if it wasn't white.Performance was better than I expected. Having 4GB of RAM helps so much compared to other budget laptops with 2GB. Just having it on uses about 2GB of RAM.I was actually surprised that this laptop can play 1080P youtube videos. I recommend turning up the saturation to about 30-40 in the Intel color settings, because its very pale by default.A big plus is that the power and charging LED is not pointing directly at you, but to the right side. However an interesting design choice was that they removed the CAPS LOCK LED and chose to use a screen overlay.I don't like the extra column of keys on the right side along with a power button so close to the BACKSPACE. The fact that the keyboard and trackpad is off-center is even more strange. There is so much space above the keyboard that they could have used. I sometimes hit some keys on the right side and all sorts of witchery happens. I set the power button to turn the screen off instead.*update, after having to evacuate because of a hurricane, the lightweight and slim profile of the laptop was not a problem when only taking one backpack with me.

I need drive speed for recording high speed astrophotography video cameras (300++fps with other things going on at the same time) and have spent 3 days trying to get a Samsung 512gb 960 Pro nvme m.2 to even be SEEN by the Predator in any slot. BTW it goes in the first slot (slot 0 is the correct slot for nvme - IF it were there at all due to lack of ability to set to AHCI in BIOS). As as aside, the original 256gb SSD works fine in slot 1 with the OS on it, is B and M keyed and only a SATA).Despite numerous calls to Acer, the best they could do was direct me to the innumerable and uninterpretable forum posts on this exact topic. Horrible lack of tech knowledge at Acer CS. While I'm not an IT guy any more, I tried all of the forum solutions other than the multi-page Rube Goldberg suggested regedit changes just to get what it was supposed to have when I bought it (note their use of PCIe in the description of the SSD without clarifying that it is ONLY SATA capable is shameful).Anyway, after I pulled the power bar while it was running and had it go black (something is wrong with ability to recognize a fully charged battery that even the 'paper-clip reset' suggestion from their tech support didn't fix) I am about to return it after days of loading software and messing with the BIOS. I am already back to looking at over-priced MSi's. Bottom line, it is poor form at best to sell a $2-3k high-end gaming machine with some Fischer-Price BIOS locked on old tech. Time is money and for the headaches I have had for 3 days of reading and re-boots, they should send me a check for $2 or 3K just to keep it.I'm willing to try once again if anyone has a solution as to how to change modes to AHCI in BIOS other than waiting for them to update the BIOS.

1452,"Bought it from Samsung's website because the delivery time on Amazon was too long.I really liked this laptop, but unfortunately the touchscreen was defective, causing erratic ghost touches and rendering it unusable unless I disabled the touchscreen. The same thing happened to a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 I purchased from Costco. There must be some quality control issue in the laptop touchscreen supply line (all computer components are made by the same China-based companies). I returned the Surface and will be returning the Chromebook Plus.If that wasn't a problem, this would have been a great product. There are different pros and cons to this laptop:3:2 screen ratio: not perfect for watching HD movies as there will be black space at the top and bottom. I actually love this aspect ratio, as it is great for reading e-textbooks, surfing the web, writing documents, basically anything productivity-oriented. It's also nice for android apps.Google Play Store: This is where you get all your android apps. Chrome OS has just been integrated with android apps and is still in beta stage. This one is a mixed bag. Some apps work and some don't. Hopefully more will become compatible over time. The apps that do work are more tuned for a tablet or phone, not for a laptop. Maybe in the future developers will try to make a Chromebook specific version of their apps, but who knows if it's worth it to devote resources for such a small market share at this point.Keyboard: I think a lot of people are picky about keyboards. It's a little cramped and is not back-lit, but I didn't have a problem with either of those issues. Unless you're not a touch-typist and consistently type in the dark, I don't really see much reason to have a back-lit keyboard, to be honest. I guess it's just one of those ""premium"" add-ons. Also, it drains battery life.Build: It says it has a ""full metal body,"" but it feels like plastic. That being said, it seems like a quality build and looks amazing. It kind of has that rounded-edge form factor you see on the new Apple and Samsung phones. I haven't have an issues with the touchpad, just the touchscreen.Chrome OS: This was actually the first Chromebook I bought and have mixed feelings about it. Besides the disappointment of receiving a defective product, there are certain things about Chrome OS that leave me with mixed feelings. Chrome OS is basically the Chrome browser along with some added functionality like a file viewing system. Chrome OS's ""apps"" are actually just weblinks that bring you to the ""webapp"" of whatever you're trying to use. If your main goals are just web browsing and word processing then a Chromebook should be more than adequate. I liked the pricetag and the fact that Chromebooks run fast despite being so cheap. I you were to get a comparatively priced Windows laptop it would probably be lacking in the performance area. With a Chromebook, all you have is Chrome OS, so performance is not as important. The advent of android apps brings even more functionality, but these apps are still made for tablets and smartphones. I found that both the webapp version and android app version of Microsoft Onenote were inferior to the actual Onenote program on Windows 10.",2,4,5,4,5

It restored perfectly and I was very careful in setting up the initial password to be sure that I had the correct password for the Microsoft e-mail account. Everything is fine now.

The battery life is good, and you can do all kinds of cool stuff on it. I am not the best with computers, but this is super easy to figure out and use on a daily basis. So, if you are a college student and debating on whether or not to purchase this, I say YES.",2,4,5,4,5

Only issue I had was a brief scare with it acting up and wouldn't allow me to log in, gave me a blue screen. I thought it was over! I'm not super tech savy but still know my way around for a little above the basics so I managed to fiddle in the advanced options and got it back - phew!

I use this laptop for schoolwork, web browsing, and occasional video streaming. The system runs fine when I have Spotify, 3-4 tabs in Chrome, and MSWord open all at the same time. The HD screen is great, but it look a bit of getting used to since everything shows up smaller. Battery life is excellent, too, all of which is a nice surprise for a machine at this price range.My only (very minor) complaint is that I'd like the maximum screen brightness to be a bit brighter, for when I'm working in really bright rooms.

Only con is that it requires constant power to actually play games at decent framerates, which is understandable considering the 1060 is almost on par with the desktop variant but it defeats the purpose of a portable gaming laptop. Sleek design does collect finger prints rather easily, and theyre very hard to get rid of. Screen looks great with deep blacks and good colors. Either backlight bleeding or ips glow is a minor issue with this laptop but still annoying to the average perfectionist. And a touch sensor is a very nice addition.

1495,It's a really good laptop after a hard drive upgrade to an m.2. I wouldn't label this laptop under gaming mainly because of the battery not the graphics card.

1498,"Bought this laptop knowing the screen wasn't the best. Read the other reviews and thought it couldn't be that bad, well it is but I plan on replacing it down the line and I'm happy with the performance so I'm going to keep it. Ordered the laptop and at the same time I ordered:Crucial 8GB DDR4 2400 MT/S (PC4-19200) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory (CT8G4SFS824A)andADATA SU800 M.2 2280 128GB Ultimate 3D NAND Solid State Drive (ASU800NS38-128GT-C)The upgrade of 8GB memory and the 128GB SSD really makes this a great performing laptop. Did the install before turning the laptop on the first time, took it out of the package, removed one screw, removed the cover plate and installed the SSD and SODIIM, closed it up and fired it up for the first time. The laptop recognized the added memory without any additional steps needed on my behalf. I let the system run it's start up and after it was ready to use I downloaded the image program offered by ADATA on their web site, transferred the drive to the SSD and rebooted, they system automatically recognized the new boot drive, once I confirmed the transfer was good to do I reformatted the 1T hard drive into a storage drive and now have a fast booting system with plenty of memory for $827.94 bucks (Laptop was $709, SSD $55.99 and SODIMM $62.95). Not a bad deal. Watch the prices on Amazon, they go up and down often. Add the parts you want to your cart and save for later or put them in a Wish List. Buy when they hit your price point.Now for the screen, since I started using the laptop I have had headaches, I don't know if it's because I'm using it more than my 7 year old XPS 1703 Dell or if it's because of the screen. I'm going to blame the screen. I plan on swapping it out for an IPS screen like one reviewer constantly points out in his reviews and comments. Reading the how-to it appears to be something I could do easily and the screen was priced at under $70 when I last checked.As for performance, this machine is great, I was able to play Skyrim on max settings, kick some tail on Players Unknown Battlegrounds and effortlessly surf the web with many browser windows open. Great laptop for not a lot of money. Some might say I had to MOD the computer to get this performance and to a point this is true, however I searched and didn't find another machine in this price range with this level of hardware for a comparable price. To me it was well worth the additional effort to make this laptop meet my needs.",1,0,1,2,2

1522,"This thin and light notebook computer was not purchased for gaming but for work. It has the correct components for how I use it, plus, it has an 8th generation intel cpu, has room for a SSD, and for up to 32GB of ram, unusual for an ASUS, but a pleasant surprise, from my past experience with ASUS, having made three previous purchases. In my business, I am constantly downloading large files (3-4 GB) and then watching the digital footage, maybe editing it, and re-editing it. This notebook is perfect for how I use it, and it's light and seems sturdy, though the case appears to be all plastic. It doesn't have as many USB ports as I'd like, but it has enough for the price point (isn't that why they have USB hubs?) and, of course, no optical drive, but I have a nice blu-ray external drive that cost me about $20, which is small, light, and handy to carry in the carry sleeve I bought to go with the notebook. It would nice if it had a docking station of some sort, but that wasn't a deal breaker, just an afterthought. The most important lesson I learned is to read the warranty before you buy the product, because, this one is only 1 year (which I knew), will not be extended by the manufacturer, which I didn't know, (leaving you to wrestle with the decision whether or not to take your chances or go with a third party warranty company that I have found, in the past, is a useless expense and then there is also, insurance that can be purchased, but I haven't done that either or ever) and allows the manufacturer to pick up almost anything off the street to replace or repair parts that need replacing or repairing, &, if they work, then it's fixed so far as the manufacturer is concerned; they've discharged their obligation under their warranty. Had I to do it all over, I would pick a manufacturer that only made repairs and replacements with new parts, if any exist out in the notebook world, or maybe they are all like that (haven't had time to read the other warranties, yet, but will before my next purchase). Analysis at this point is that was a smart purchase and everything functions as it should, though a ram upgrade is in the near future, as 8 gigs is tasked every time I use the machine, but adequate for now. I would buy another one, at this point, because of the price point, and pray it doesn't need any repairs. However, for 3-4 hundred dollars more, maybe a better warranty and machine could be had; that extra 3-4 hundred was not in my budget so I didn't really look. I'll be back if any important updates are in order.",2,0,1,2,2

Special modifications or external modules were unnecessary. My previous laptop was a 2013 Macbook Air. Suspend and resume work, ACPI lid events are sensible and not noisy (on the Macbook, I had them just turned off).---Awful screen glareI've almost always used my Macbook Air with a matte screen protector, but the difference is *glaring*. I don't understand why LG offered no options in the 2018 line up with a matte display. I think one of the reasons it feels even worse is because black reproduction is so good on the laptop. As a result, more of the glare is visible. Hopefully, a matte screen protector will solve this issue, though, I'm not able to find good ones at this time.It's a really good display that could be much improved with a matte screen.---Off-center keyboardThis is by no means a major flaw, but who even benefits from this.

1531,"For what my mother uses this for, it is perfect for her. A million times better than that cheap crappy trash HP she used to have (that she now no longer touches). Although I am disappointed in one thing, the right touchpad key tends to stay down either when neither button is clicked for a while or the right button is clicked multiples times consecutively. It's fine once you click the left mouse button once but it can be annoying. Every light indicator is on the front side of the laptop keyboard in a row, where your left wrist is likely to cover it when typing.Edit: It appears the touchpad thing is not uncommon among laptops with that particular type of seamless, full touch touchpad. Mine does it to. Bumped this laptop up to 5 stars. Now I know for the next laptop I get that the physical touch buttons are better as they have never given me problems before. I hope they don't get phased out of gaming laptops anytime soon. This particular laptop is holding up pretty well, I would definitely say it is great for students with every day school work, studying, etc. If you use the touch pad with your right hand, be prepared to reach over a bit farther than usual, I personally don't like that the touchpad is so far to the left but it's nothing much to complain about. Unless you like to play games using WASD+Touch, in which case this is a very irritating setup. I can say nothing about the fingerprint scanner as my mother doesn't use it.

1535,"The item arrived just as pictured. The look and feel is great. The surfaces are covered in a soft rubber that makes if feel comfortable to rest your palm or wrist on and also provide better grip than the normal plastic material most laptops come with at this price range. For a gaming oriented laptop it is definitely more on the sleek end of the style spectrum and the red accents are a darker in colour. The mousepad and keys are very responsive. I have fairly large hands and the smaller keys are still not an issue, although the direction keys are the smallest I have seen on any keyboard layout and could be bigger in my opinion.Specs wise, I researched fairly extensively, and for the 699 deal I got this laptop for there was nothing that could match. No system on any major retailer I could find had a laptop with an i7-7700 and a 1050 at 700 unless it did not have windows installed. For the 899 regular price there are certainly competitive options, but if it's on sale again I'm sure you will not be disappointed.

The whole finish is matted, which I'm a fan of.Plenty of ports. Looks great. (Just like photos)The Screen. I read alot of reviews where this was the most disappointing part of the laptop due to quality issues. I find (switch to it from a high quality touch screen) that yes it is lacking a bit however as for as display quality I believe the issue lies more in the defult contrast and color settings. After looking up where to find the calibration setting I went through the steps and lowered contrast and brightness, then color sturation. After this the screen looked so much better. Complete game changer. I don't even think about it anymore. If you do alot of Photoshop for photo editing you may not want this laptop but I think thoes are the only people who need to worry about the screen.Of course if you can afford a higher price point and your worried about mind blowing display then go for another laptop. But for people wanting a laptop with a good processor AND graphics card for games and Adobe style products in this price range this is going to work great for you.Think it's more of a 4.5 because to get it to 5 you need to mess with the settings a bit.Have played games like league or ledgends, wow, and other online games (Been told it would run ARC as well)Use it for my graphic design classes and projects as well.",1,0,1,2,2

For me this was an utter waste of money, but I'll admit that if you just need a laptop to browse the web and never plan on saving anything to the actual computer... Well, this would possibly work. On the other hand, a few security updates down the road and you might find yourself in the same boat with all the memory filled up.

1554,"Ive been looking for a replacement for my 5-year-old MacBook Air and I think I may have finally found it in the Surface Laptop by Microsoft. There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard Ive used yet- Precision touchpad is the best Ive used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but wheres charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyIve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. Id already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasnt an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didnt take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSIve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but thats not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. Theres some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and theres a special coating on it to help keep it clean. Im not that worried about it, but just in case, Ill probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while Im using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one. Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. Thats it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish wouldve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port wouldve helped future-proof the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but its not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when youre traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. Its colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I wouldve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but arent the best for reading documents and websites. I dont mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that its not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldnt be disabled in the Full HD version. I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreenduh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that youre likely to use it on this screen. Whenever Ive used the touchscreen, its been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, theyre still laptop speakers, but theyre some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so muchmore than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptops. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. Its fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers arent making the switch is beyond me, but I think its a huge mistake. If youre a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why youve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a pro or gaming laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD thats integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so Im really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. Ive read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You cant get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devils advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that dont need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so its definitely a compromise thats understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably wont be that noticeable unless youre frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasnt going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. Im used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didnt even know Marvell made wireless cards. Ive had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what Ive read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what Im getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously cant store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but thats true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything theyd learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, its a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, Id say its no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I dont think theyll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and theres no other laptop Id rather have right now.",0,2,3,2,4

1556,"I have had my computer only for a week now but so far so good. Windows 10 was a bit goofy setting up. I called Lenovo and they wanted about $70 to have someone help me finishing set everything up. I did a few reboots and was able to do it myself.Im not 100% sure I would recommend this to a beginner computer user, but I think I would to a fearless computer user.Nice big screen and the keyboard has more on it (than my computer I am replacing) including 10 key pad. My previous computer had a very small computer and was very comfortable for me. This keyboard is a little more spread out so it may be more comfortable for a mans hands.Anyway, does what I need it to do.",3,2,1,4,2
1557,"In 2007 I bought a new Dell Inspiron laptop, and in the ten years that followed I used the heck out of it. I edited thousands of documents, wrote software on it, even edited audio and video files, all running on a Socket 775 Core2 Duo processor. That laptop is still running today, although it can't compete with the processors and underlying architecture of new systems; they're just so much faster and more capable overall.Fast forward to two weeks ago. I purchased this new ""gaming"" laptop, expecting a system that would meet my needs for today and years into the future. So far my experience with this ""state of the art"" laptop has been anything but great. Sure, it's nice to look at with the dull, almost rubbery outer coating, the sleek red lines and illuminated, full-size keyboard. The laptop is, on paper, a very capable system, and I so wish it would have been what I hoped, but alas it falls fall very short.My two biggest complaints about this system by far are the display, and the unit's tendency to hang/hesitate.The LCD display on this is atrocious. You have such a narrow vertical viewing angle that you simply can't view the whole screen at its optimal contrast at the same time. When you tilt the display to put the ""sweet spot"" across the middle, the upper and lower sections of the display show that telltale reflection common on older, and lower end LCD panels, that makes images look washed out, almost shiny or inverted. And even the portion of the screen that's optima has the dullest, most uninspiring color and contrast I've seen since LCD's first hit the market in the early 2000s. Imagine one of those old projection televisions in a bar, with 4-5 years of smoke and dust film on the lenses, and you have an idea how washed out and unimpressive is this display. The problem is the choice of technology: Dell chose an LCD panel that uses Twisted Numatic (TN) technology to render the pixels. It can't hold a candle to the newer Inter-Plane Switching (IPS) displays, which Apple uses almost exclusively due to their superior color and contrast, or the latest Organic LED (OLED) panels, which represent the very best in color and contrast. No, this panel is something you'd expect to see on a $49 no-name tablet, or an early ATM machine. I can't stop shaking my head over this, because IPS panels aren't but a few dollars more than TN panels, and it would have a HUGE difference in the overall look and usability of this product.As bad as the LCD is, the other issue is much worse, by far. That is the laptop's tendency to hang or hesitate. I noticed this right out of the box, and even after wiping the drive and installing a pristine (i.e. bloatware-free) Windows 10 image, the system seems to hesitate, every few minutes, for anywhere from 5-15 seconds. The cursor pops up the ""busy"" spinning circle, and nothing responds to mouse clicks until seconds later. I've updated the drivers to the very latest version, shut down unneeded services, even flashed the UEFI BIOS to the latest version, but this hesitation continues, and it's bad enough that it's become a dealbreaker for me. I've read stories from other people who've had the same issue with this, so my gut tells me it's probably a behavior I'll have to learn to live with, and I'm just not willing to spend $800+ on something that can't do any better than that.Sorry, Amazon, but I gotta send this stinker back.",1,0,3,2,2
1558,"MY REASONS FOR BUYING: I purchased this laptop for homework (I am a college student) as well as watch movies using an external drive to when I am traveling. I am not a fan of tablets because I prefer typing my papers on a keyboard and Windows Operating System works well for me.FIRST IMPRESSIONS: When I first unboxed the laptop, it was as small as I had expected. As compact as the package was, the keyboard is still easy to type on, the buttons don't depress far at all and it has that classic laptop keyboard feel. I did find, that when typing, I turn of the touchpad because my resting hands seems to move the mouse and will mess me up (easy fix). The touchpad is responsive, and the left and right clicking is easy to operate and haven't had to fight it very much like some other touch pads.CONTINUED USE: I have been happy with the duration of battery life, even when watching movies and typing papers, I can use this laptop for most of the day before having to charge again. It does not heat up significantly like other laptops that I have had (I am assuming because of the size) and it is a very quiet system. I have typed about 15 multi-page essays on this laptop and my hands have yet to cramp up, so I'd say they did a great job with the design with the little space that they had to work with.OVERALL: I would highly recommend this laptop if you are looking for a mobile work station, or something to view multimedia on during the day. The small display makes it difficult to replace a larger computer or laptop, but if you are like myself and would rather avoid a pricey tablet, I recommend this for you. When I bought this, it also came with a year-long subscription to Microsoft office, which is an absolute treat and is the cherry on top of this machine.",3,1,5,4,3

The first one came with a tiny dead pixel in the middle of the screen(sadly) and Amazon was quick to get me a replacement before I left US. Amazon prime shipping helps!I went with the i7/512GB SSD and added a 2TB firecuda as there was an unused HDD slot. Now I feel I have a very good configuration.I read some reviews that it is heavy, yes I do agree as well. But ask yourself, do you need a lightweight ultra book which takes 2x times to process your tasks or a powerful laptop which is a desktop replacement?Barring the fan sound on occasions of heavy processing and 2X8GB RAM modules it came with (I would have liked it better had it come with 1x16GB module - you know its easier to get it to 32GB without any wastage), I felt it to be a decent pick.

1562,"I really,really wanted to like this Chromebook. I did a lot of research, reading about the good and bad, but I made the plunge. It is an attractive device and I like the build quality.

I installed the Netflix app from the Playstore and when scrolling the screen jumps back and forth. Two other apps I installed (Facebook and Yahoo mail) failed to work at all. Finally, the wifi range of this device is the worst of any that I have ever tried in my house.I feel like I bought a device that was still in beta testing, not ready for Prime time.

First the good stuff--I'm a novelist so the keyboard is extremely important to me. The size of the keys, the distance between them, and the sound, need to be spot-on. I like the keyboard on this Dell in every way (except the touchpad is a bit flaky and launches my cursor into the document). The speed is very good for what I do (90% word processing with some browsing and occasional streamed movie). The color and clarity of the screen is also very good and the speakers are surprisingly good. No problems there. The weight is not what I would call ""light"" but it is an improvement from my old Dell laptop from 8 years ago. And the battery--very good, again relative to what I do.My problem is with the fan. It turns on after about 30 minutes of word processing--and won't go off. And it is loud compared to some laptops I have used with SSDs that are so quiet for so long you wonder if they are even on. Not this machine. That is a problem for me since the distraction is, well, distracting. I thought with the quadcore and 16GB of RAM is would stay relatively cool and quiet. Nope. It is whizzing now after twenty minutes of use and shows no sign of letting up. If not for the fan, I would gladly give this otherwise fine performer a solid five stars.

1600,"Wow, after 30+ years in the IT development and support industry, I found building a Linux kernel, and building a laptop from scratch easier than figuring out how to set a passphrase in Chrome. The Chrome help is a nightmare, and I think operating system and general google changes invalidates most of the advice that one can find online. I am pretty frustrated. Sound worked out of the box, but then, by waving my hand or something, it stopped working. Also sync won't work, and I can find no way to put in a ""passhrase"". All the ""helps"" are not helpful, because the Icons, words or whatever ""they"" say to click on, AREN' THERE! (software changes?)Unless you have more patience than Job, or nothing else to do for a month or so. don't try a chromebook.",2,2,5,4,2
1601,"Excellent gaming machine, non-existant Linux support. This would have been a really great workstation if someone had invested a bit of time and effort in providing drivers for their platform for Linux. I didn't buy this for gaming though, I bought this to be my workstation. With a powerful 1070 GPU and the capacity for two M2 drives and a SATA drive, a 7th gen i7 and upto 64G of RAM, it makes a perfect high end portable developer machine.Dear Acer, it's almost 2018, get some official Linux support please. You replied back to my question of linux support by saying it's unreasonable to expect Linux support, and that I should use your community forums for help. I looked there, whenever anyone asks for Linux support, nobody answers and the question gets closed, so nobody can help. This is why I only gave 3 stars and not 5. It's barbaric to sell laptops in this day and age without providing Linux drivers and support.The keyboard is nice. Not mechanical Cherry Red keyswitch nice, but good enough - much better than the new zero travel keys on Macbooks. Good travel, a bit clicky, but not too much. The backlight is nice, but wish it was just white or red instead of rainbow colored. I suppose if Acer did support Linux properly they'd have drivers that let you set it differently...The case material however is bad. While it's sturdy, it collects fingerprints like you wouldn't believe. Have to constantly wipe it down. Both on the outside when the lid closed and on the inside and even the keys. Never had this issue with Apple, Lenovo, Dell or or other laptops.Good set of USB ports a nice USB C port (no, not for charging the laptop).I don't know how good the 2TB Seagate drive it came with is, it does run hot. I immediately replaced it with a 2TB SATA Samsung SSD instead.If you want to add a 2nd M2 drive know that the top M2 slot will require an adapter to install. It's physically too long and the SSD will swing in the wind with nothing to anchor it down otherwise. M2 adapters will not work right. I had to resort to tape to get it to work with an M2 adapter.While there is a security slot, the bay that contains the memory and SSDs is protected only by a thin plastic cover that is somewhat flimsy and is locked only by screws. It should have some kind of lock on it so someone can't flip your machine over and steal your RAM/disks.The core cooler that slides into the DVD slot is great. I haven't bothered with optical discs in quite some time, though it's nice to have the option, I'd rather have the extra fan that it provides, that was a good design decision.The BIOS is quite flaky. Had to disable secure UEFI and switch to legacy boot to get Ubuntu to work nicely with encrypted disks, though this is more of a Linux issue than a BIOS issue, however the signed EFI bootloaders for linux can be added, but the BIOS wasn't written by folks with skills in English, and it's quite confusing trying to figure out what the error messages were trying to convey.In the BIOS, you can mark an EFI boot file as trusted, but if you try to remove it and add it back in because you gave up on a previous OS install and wiped the disk, it will say it's already added and offer no way to remove it, and worse, it won't work because it's not from the same installation as when it was added! In the end I gave up in disgust and went with Legacy MBR boot. Shameful.What works: video (with nvidia drivers off their site), keyboard, trackpad. Left hand side macro keys do not work. acer-wmi prints ""acer_wmi: Unknown function number - 7 - 1"" in /var/log/syslog. Sound from the headphone jack. WiFi Bluetooth USB 3 and USB C ports Suspend Upgrading the RAM to the maximum of 64GWhat doesn't work: Speaker sound only comes out of the ""subwoofer"" which is somewhat on the left hand side. The front speakers do not show up at all. Even with the daily build of alsa daily, likely because acer-wmi needs updating. Closing the lid case does not cause the laptop to hibernate or sleep. Opening the case, however, does wake it. You have to use the power button before you close the lid! (Basically the lid switch acts as a keyboard HID but uses a non-standard keycode.) The screen will not dim. You can hack something up that uses xbacklight to dim the screen and that works. The backlight will not turn off when the notebook is locked. You'll get a black screen but you'll see the mouse pointer. To actually turn off the backlight and prevent shortening the life of the display you'll need to press FN+F6 after you lock the OS. Hibernate does not work. Takes a very long time to dump RAM to the disk, and then crashes the OS. Randomly, when waking from suspend, it wakes up without the keyboard connected, so you can't type your password to unlock it, though the mouse works. If you can put it to sleep and wake it up again, sometimes it comes back, or you can try to plug in an external keyboard and then the built in keyboard might come back - however, sometimes the power switch won't allow suspending when it when in this state (because the power switch is also an HID device that shows up as a type of keyboard) so you might need to hard power cycle it! When a new nvidia driver comes out, if you don't immediately reboot after installing it, suspending it and waking it will show a pinstripe screen and the OS will crash because the GPU crashed. /var/log/syslog will also show GPU warnings saying the kernel drivers are different for the GPU - this of course is an nvidia issue. You should not use the ubuntu provided nvidia drivers.I got it to work with Ubuntu 17.10 after much wrestling. 16.04.2 does not function well at all. The core issue is that acer-wmi doesn't fully support this machine.",2,0,1,0,1
1602,"A great gaming laptop, but not the best. I would not recommend this product because of the LCD screen is cheap and very bad. However, the graphics and gameplay are magnificent because of the Intel Core i7 and NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX. The battery life is okay, but you would definitely want to take your charger with you when you're going somewhere with it. The design looks normal and it's not that heavy, which makes this laptop easy to travel with and even take it to your work place or school. There are way more better gaming laptops than this. Although, the graphics are magnificent on this, the LCD screen is trash. This just hurts my eyes after few hours of playing GTA V.

1627,"My 48 hours review of the New Microsoft Surface Laptop with my Pros and Cons...I originally planned on ordering my PC from Amazon but I ended up placing my order directly through the Microsoft Store and doing an in-store pick up. I was able to receive a 10% student discount so it made the price lower than anywhere else.I went with the Graphite Gold i5, 8gb, 256 - this configuration meets all of my needs since I don't do any gaming or do I run any heavy programs. My use will be web browsing, school and business use with Office 365, some light photoshop or camtasia every now and again, and streaming video so this compute meets all of my needs. I upgraded it to 10 Pro right out of the box since I don't want to be limited to Windows Store Apps only.The Alcantara wrapping is OK, I can see it getting very dirty and showing wear and aging at the 6 month mark, Microsoft says to just keep it clean by regularly wiping it downs using a damp lint free cloth. I personally will have this laptop connected to a docking station while at home and use a wireless keyboard and mouse along with a bigger monitor connected via hdmi from the mini display port so I am not that concern with it the Alcantara getting dirty and faded. I will only type on it directly when I am at school and I usually take hand written notes on legal pads so I'll make sure to keep it clean. Also with the Microsoft Complete for Surface Laptop you can get 2 yrs of coverage from damage and issues.Pros ++ The touch screen is excellent! The touch screen is really great and has works flawlessly so far.+ The screen and the resolution is excellent, the picture quality and brightness is the best of any computer I have owned and it should be as this has the highest resolution screen.+ The built quality feels premium and heavy with the aluminum casing.+ The Windows Hello Facial Recognition was a big selling point for me, it works great and you will have hands free sign-in.+ The speeds seems faster than the 15"" laptop I replaced which also had an i5 from an early generation at 3.2. That PC is still working perfectly I just wanted a new laptop.+ The keyboard is nice with 4 adjustable black light settings (off, low, med, high) and feel while typing is so quality and smooth.Cons -- The color could have been more vibrant with a bit more pop, I think I would have like the cobalt blue color better. But it is still a nice color.- The touch track pad sucks! Maybe I have to make some adjustments to it but so far it's too sensitive and responsive doing other things on its own I did not want.- Cost, it's a bit on the higher end. It is a premium product without a doubt so I guess you have to pay a little extra for that Microsoft quality. It's the same price as the 13"" Macbook Pro which I considered but ruled out because I prefer Windows.Another beautiful option to consider and the one I had to think about for a few weeks is the new HP SPECTER x360. That is a gorgeous computer with higher specifications for the same price. You can get a i7 a better graphics card and the same premium look and feel of quality with an aluminum body. The main reasons I decided on the Surface Laptop was the Windows Hello Face Recognition.",0,2,3,2,4
1628,"Overall it's a pretty good little computer. I like the small size, I can fit it easily in my purse. (I wouldn't describe my purse as small, but its not a huge one either. Just average size.) Good battery life. Nice monitor display. It doesn't have a lot of storage on it, so I would recommend an external hard drive with it. The computer itself also offers the option of uploading saved items to Google so you can retrieve them from any device. Doesn't have a lot of ram either, so it's not the greatest for running multiple programs at once. Ex. I was trying to listen to a video while playing a game of tetris. It got the job done, but it did struggle a bit so definitely not a gaming computer. The video by itself, minus the tetris game, had great playback however. That was Youtube, I haven't tried Netflix yet. It's a light weight, light use, one-thing-at-a-time device, which is all you can really expect from a $200 device. It looks and behaves a lot like a macbook, which is funny when you consider that apple would charge upwards of $1000 for a their version of the product, haha.",3,1,5,4,3

I highly recommend this laptop to anyone who doesn't care about bringing their charger with them. I also suggest you buy a screen protector for this computer, it gets fingerprints on it so easily, it not one of those displays that has a plastic cover over it like touchscreen's.The display is very nice and has a HDR like feel to it, the color depth is great, very HD.

1634,"I set this laptop up with Gallium OS booting off a flash drive and it's working perfectly. Running through the USB port the operating system is *almost* as snappy as the native Chrome OS. There very occasional moments of lag that last 5-8 seconds but I think it's still faster than a laptop using HDD. Gallium is made for Chromebook hardware, between that and the SSD it's fast. I'm using the machine as secondary web development laptop and have Visual Studio Code, MySQL Workbench, Koala, Filezilla, GIT, NPM installed and over 100 gigs to spare on the partitioned USB 3 flash drive. After getting setup I've actually gotten a lot of work accomplished on thing. I've had no need to dual boot into Chrome OS since installing Gallium.I prefer this style of plastic Chromebook laptop shell over the aluminum 14-15 inch Chromebooks. I read the Lenovo N42 was designed to hold up while being used by students in public schools. If I take half as good care of the laptop as I would have when I was 16 years old there should be no issues.The monitor mount to the laptop body is is solid and doesn't wiggle. For some reason the display seems always either slightly too dark or too bright but never quite just right. Functionally the screen is more than adequate.The keys feel good when I press them and don't feel like they're going to break off or get pushed in. One of the aluminum Chromebooks I was looking at had sleeker keys and a seemingly more refined key press experience, but I don't like that as much as the punchy plastic keys on the N42.The battery life is not as good as I expected but much better than other not-Chromebook laptops I have. It seems comparable to the battery life of a Macbook Pro I used to have. I've got a Samsung 11 inch Chromebook that has amazing battery life, but I don't like using it because the screen is too small. This 14 inch N42 is a good balance between acceptable screen size and reasonable battery life.The ports are awesome, USB 3.0 is meeting my expectations. In terms of speed my flash drives seem to work as fast as any hardware drives installed in machine. Easily good enough for my purposes.After using this laptop for a few weeks with Gallium OS installed I really can't imagine the MacBook Air/MacBook Pro would be that much better considering the cost of both machines. I can't really do heavy graphics manipulation or processing but I never need to so for me that's not an issue. 13 inch screens on a Macbook Pro or Air for $1000+ is a little too small for my taste, 15 inch Macbooks are $2000+ so they are out, 12 inch Macbook screen for $1000+ no way. My point is, with this Chromebook I can functionally do all the things a Macbook does, but for $1000 less and I still get an elegant OS. I feel for my graphic designer friends who have to spend money to get good screens, but I can get away with this awesome little laptop for under $300 dollars.It's probably important to note without having installed Gallium OS I wouldn't be as excited about this laptop. Gallium wasn't exactly easy to install so if this sounds interesting, do a little research on what it would take before blindly purchasing to make sure your computer skills are up for the task. There are plenty of instructions online.",2,2,4,4,2

1640,"This laptop is a definite improvement over my older HP Elitebook 8440p that had a dual core i5 at 2.5GHz. It is faster and just more responsive, plus had a much larger hard drive and more RAM (12GB vs 8). I kinda wish I'd gone with a higher speed processor (this one is 1.6GHz) as I think it would be MUCH faster overall (that's the only reason for the 4 star instead of 5 star). But for programs that take advantage of it, the quad core i5 definitely speeds things up. Very large spreadsheets (30,000 records and many fields/columns) are surprisingly fast to process with complex formulas. And FWIW, I kinda like the color. Drawbacks are that it's fairly flimsy plastic, a little heavy, and the power button is a little hard to push. But for the price (just over $500 when I bought it)? Great!",3,2,0,2,2

1642,"The reason I bought this computer is I wanted a lap top with a touch screen, and what attracted me to this specific one is the description that the product can run android apps from the google play store. I have to say this is the worst purchase I have ever did! The product runs fine, the touch screen works well. The internet connectivity is very ""moody"" shall we say, it connects whenever it feels like it, which is 50-60% of the time, and I find myself more often than not having to restart computer. And now it is not connecting at all! The other thing that is advertised for this product is it supports a micro SD that can be used for storage. Turns out that if you load apps from the play store, The android part of this computer DOES NOT support storage on a micro SD card, and it only allows you to load it on the main memory, which is limited to 32 GB only!. Speaking of the android apps, not all of them download and run smoothly. I wanted to get my kindle books on it..... no such luck. the books won't download and I always get ""error"" messages. The last thing you should be aware of is the processor is not an Intel processor, and some reviews mention that this maybe the reason for the computer going slow when attempting to run multiple programs or open many tabs within the browser at once. My kids have older chromebooks from Dell with Intel processors and they run very well! Bottom line, as excited as I was to buy this computer, I totally regret my purchase now. If you insist on buying a chromebook with a touch screen and a play store compatibility STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG! You are better off buying the Asus with 64 GB internal memory and an intel processor.

Why on Earth?) and B. the exact same model is available for $400 from Acer's website minus the SSD, which is < $100 here on Amazon.

1662,"Not the best computer, not even close to the best. It's big. 17"" screen w/ a dvd drive and it weighs over 7 pounds. It is NOT a laptop it's more of a portable desktop. You cannot read the keys from any angle because they are the same color as the case so they blend in so well that you have to be directly over the keys to read them. And did I say it is slow. It takes 2-4 minutes to boot, and that's after I removed some of the bloat ware (skype and the anti-virus). There are no visible ready lights, so you don't know at any point of time what's going on or even if the computer is actually on. No owner's manual, not even a cd, so it's hard to get started. Some of the problems may be the operating system, Win 10. Maybe w/ Win 7 it would speed up a bit and be easier to use. As it stands now it is virtually worthless to me and I can't send it back as it was a birthday gift bought in February gifted in March, the day before the return date. Oh well, it might make an OK door stop or boat anchor. Oh yeah, it does have a beautiful screen but that's all I can say nice about this POS.",1,1,1,4,1

I was able to play counterstrike on here with no lag, on wifi internet. This laptop is the epitome of cheap budget school laptop. Had it for a few months now and its my go-to. WIFI is fast, great graphics for the price and loads everything well. May need to delete some spamware or extra apps you dont need and download google chrome with ghostery and ublock origin; this just completes the laptop. There are ways to increase speed as well.As for the cons, IF i am running some major programs like quick books, MIVA MERCHANT, spotify, chrome, excel, calender, sticky notes, etc at the same time, there is a slight lag. Its not good for data entry that requires real time processing, but great if you need to take notes or watch videos.BTW PLZ BE ADVISED: THIS IS NOT GOLD, MORE LIKE CHAMPAGNE COLOR.TL:DR GREAT LAPTOP, CANNOT RUN MULTI DATA PROCESSING WINDOWS, GREAT FOR VIDEOS OR NOTE TAKING",3,1,5,4,3

My experience with ""Certified Refurbished"" is that a customer bought something, and for some small reason, the item was returned to the manufacturer who fixed it and then slapped the ""Certified Refurbished"" label on there and the item is supposed to be better than new in many cases. But this thing came out of the box reeking of the abuse that it had received. This Chromebook had been heavily used -- signs of wear all over it in terms of scratches and paint literally worn off. It was horrible. But I am a good sport. I took responsibility because I had stupidly failed to read the reviews -- most of them warned me that this would happen!

1673,"What I needed: lightweight, portable, cloud-ish based..but not totally a chromebook, for mainly writing and using research websites/apps...nothing serious, no games, rarely video, 4GB of RAM and an expandable HD.I took a risk and bought this through Amazon Warehouse and it was ""used-like new"". When it arrived, it looked brand-new - only the box was open. The plug still had the protective plastic cover on it. The aesthetics of this computer are wonderful, the ""gold"" seems like a light-sensitive metallic, for example under ""cool"" light, it appears more sliver-gold. Then under ""warm"" lights, it looks rose gold. Also the brushed texture adds to the metal appearance. The keys have a nice touch, very clicky, although I can't wait until the new wears off. Its crazy lightweight and thin (I'm updating from an old netbook...yeah...a netbook - so this thing is like a spaceship). Performance is pretty standard for what you're getting, luckily the Amazon models come with 4GB of RAM, which helps. However, I agree with other reviewers and get ad-blockers immediately for internet use. Luckily it has a microSD port since the 32GB HD is half taken up by the OS. Its smart to order at least a 64GB microSD card to add some storage.My one-star demotion comes from the issues with the pre-loaded OS (go figure). Everything booted up fine, but the App Store wouldn't work...or any of the associated apps from the store. After some failed troubleshooting and googling, I finally just hit up Microsoft Support Chat. They sent me a link to re-install Microsoft 10. It took forever, but it worked. This makes me wonder if someone bought this computer, had that problem and didn't want to deal, so they returned it. Its all good now.Oh...and Cortana, the assistant...it would be great if you could choose what search engine it uses, but alas, Microsoft handcuffed themselves to bing. If you are real computer savy there maybe a couple of intense work arounds, but for us layman, Microsoft fix the loophole that allowed easy internet extensions to sidetrack bing. So that sucks.Compared to anything else that's not a chromebook for under $200, its by far the nicest looking. If you need a commuter or just something small to type on...this is a steal. If you face the same weird app problem (they just appear grayed out, non-responsive)...just go to the Support Chat.",3,1,5,4,3

I bought this laptop shortly before my Asus tablet died so I'm O for 2 with this manufacturer. While they are fully aware of their inadequacies their customer service alarmingly is worse than their build quality (given the low threshold this is remarkable). In both cases the motherboards failed and I suspect their strategy is too avoid repair through attrition. The customer service process is so slow and ineffective that the hours i wasted were not worth the purchase price. You might know the routine, they request documentation and redundant forms but when questioned they have no answers. Reaching a supervisor is like requesting an audience with the pope.

It formerly had it installed but it doesn't have it installed now.PROS:My laptop came in GREAT shape (no dings or anything).I'm a student and MS Office can be utilized online for free though my school, so I don't *HAVE* to download it (but I'm clearing up memory and I'm going to).Overall: I think it'll get the job done. I'm a college student and a busy mom of three. While it's slower than my desktop, I think after a little adjusting, it'll get the job done.

It's a shame if it doesn't work out. Form my little interaction with it so far, I was actually surprised by the screen quality. It's really nice. And the touchpad itself feels like glass when you run your fingers over it. Great looking device. However, I will update with my results.Update: After months of usage I have to say this laptop is UNUSABLE. It has very little memory to be useful for anything - it can't even support Microsoft Windows updates without running out of space.

1684,"Fast, keyboard feels wonderful, as a basic gaming machine it does what I need at a price I can tack. I use it mainly to run multiple photo editting software, photoshop, ACDsee, some canon software and i like to run all at the same time. The processing power and graphic card is making that a breeze. I specialize in making pano's and merged photos for proper exposure and wanted a laptop that could do it without getting bogged down. This has it. Really fast, i can put together 15 raw photos (30mb size each) and while it's processing the photos still be processing batches of basic edits on my other software while I'm surfing the web and do it all with no glitches and it's fast. The flat, non glossy screen is doing a great job and showing me the correct colors also. Used the laptop to edit one set and then transferred my drive to my main calibrated monitor and was very pleased how accurate the match was. Excellent for a laptop monitor.

1691,"I gave this laptop to my husband to replace his big, clunky, slow Dell laptop. He took a look at it and declared it ""too wimpy"".. then opened it up, turned it on, and completely changed his tune. He now thinks it's the best laptop he's owned. It is small - but good things, they say, come in small packages. It is lightening fast. Husband is in finance and uses Excel. He opens up so many files at once, and does huge cut and paste between files. While his Dell would bog down and churn during these situations, the Microsoft Surface performs quickly and efficiently. Husband also loves the touch screen, though he was dubious at first. He adapted to it quickly and now prefers the touch screen to his old mouse.The laptop was easy to set up, right out of the box. The Introduction Screens walk you through setting up Wi-Fi, Cortana and a few other features. Simple for anyone. The graphics on the screen are amazing - clear and extremely high quality. We were both surprised to find no SD card port and it needs a different HDMI cable (mini display cord adapter $39). Apparently, you have to order a special (and pricey) compatible mouse ($79).We're no digital wizards or techie's. We're just folks who like to use our laptops for a variety of tasks, from watching videos and playing games (me) to processing Excel files and scrolling through online auctions (him).The fabric that surrounds the keyboard is nice, but I have to wonder how difficult it will be to clean. Another feature we don't care for is the fact you can't order up a new battery replacement. I assume you have to send the entire laptop to Microsoft for replacement. Another pricey venture, I'm sure. We both wish the tablet part of the laptop disconnected to be used independently.Pro's: it's fast, it's got great graphics, it's lightweight, it's got a touch screen.Con's: The usual accessories don't fit, pricey replacement accessories, no user battery replacement, no standard HDMI port, no SD card.It's a debate whether to give this laptop 3 or 4 stars, but the speed and graphics make up for a lot.",0,2,3,2,4

Basically, it halts for anywhere from 5 to 40 seconds and seems to happen more frequently when you move from one application to another, or even between tabs on a browser. A few months in, this has not resolved at all and has gotten worse. The computer occasionally functions even more poorly than my 6 year old raggedy laptop that I was switching off of - seriously. Luckily I haven't experienced any forced shutdowns, BUT, there have been about 3-5 times when the laptop completely freezes for minutes, forcing ME to shut it down... Extremely disappointing and disgusting for what should be a decently powerful comp.Video games function well, however; if you plan to use this laptop PURELY for gaming, then it may be worth the few hundred you might save over buying a newer, more reliable version.Otherwise, go for the most updated product.

Easy fix with larger SSD and 8gb more ram most likely for these issues.AutoDesk Maya - Rigs are smooth to place in Morrison Builder without lag, but the special effects of rain, snow, ice and such that I've coded and composed still gives lag. It doesn't freeze entirely like my old PC did. Turbo ran it efficiently for the testing that I needed at least.Photoshop - lags with brush sizes larger than 50pt. The display is purely impressive for me to customize 8K pictures. Very nice colour, tone and depth in the visual display. Also antiglare.Sony Soundforge - Does not have bass. Needs a sub or use bluetooth( not told in details about) to sync up a sub speaker or the aux port( mic port available too).Sony Vegas Pro - Converting Camtasia files and editing takes not too long for 1080p. A 4 hour stream I clipped to 12 minutes only took maybe 35 minutes to go to the highlights and editing and a 4-ten minute to finalize and convert.OBS - So, some of these may be because of the bandwidth for streaming. Currently the stream played flawless for my Intro, AFK Screen and Outro. During the stream, there was some latency issues with mic and video not syncing, but no issues with the black screen or pixelation.Gamers.Runescape and League of Legends run flawless on max settings.Perfect World, Forsaken world, Shaiya, Rusty Hearts, NeverWinter are at 60fps+ at 73% of settings maxed.Guild Wars 2, World of Warcraft, EVE and Dead by Daylight Run 60fps+ at 45-53% Of settings maxed.Fortnite, Darwin Project, PubG, Paladins Battlegrounds, H1Z1 and Ark all ran at max settings at 30fps+ without dropping. If moving to 60fps, I'd recommend upgrading ram and install on SSD instead of HDD, Wired (LAN), increasing RAM. At that point it should run close to 60fps flawless. I would recommend running these at minimum except distance for best results of competitive play.Now for the Housing.Compact, medium weight, finger print prone, dust magnet-not, easy to clean, upgrade, downgrade, and integrated with the following.Rj45 port,3.5mm jacks(2), 1 HDMI port, 1 port that I think is a female type C?, USB 3.0(2) USB 2.0(1).

It has some bloatware installed (think Candy Crush) and for better or worse it has Microsoft Office and McAfee Antivirus installed (but you need to buy license keys).The construction does not feel flimsy but the plastic build does not give a sense of durability. It feels like it will shatter if dropped. The machine is not light and the power brick is substantial. That said, it is not bad compared to a Windows gaming rig but it is a boat anchor compared to any modern Mac laptop. The keyboard is pleasantly responsive and nicely backlit but the extra lighting around WASD is annoying if you are watching a movie in a dark room. The display is surprisingly bright and vivid for watching 4K video. The trackpad, which is offset a bit to the left, is nice for one handed use. It is responsive and large enough to allow scrolling across the entire display in a single swipe.I tested the video card using Player Unknown's Battleground. It defaulted to medium to high settings and played smoothly at 60 frames per second. The card was able to comfortably drive an external monitor running a reasonably high resolution (1920x1080).My only gripe is the default power management. The throttling when the machine is unplugged is clearly noticeable. Download speeds drop by about 20 percent and the machine is noticeably slower for even common tasks like opening multiple instances of File Explorer. It can be fixed using the windows power management settings but in the hands of a novice (who does not know how to tweak windows) this machine will feel slow.I do not trust the feel of the construction on this in the hands of a 12 year old (or a clumsy 52 year old) but if you are looking for a budget gaming laptop and you don't mind carrying around the weight this is a good buy.",1,0,3,2,2

1713,"I purchased the 14"" Quad Core E2-6110 32GB L402W Model for $199. I needed a decent cheap work laptop and decided to purchase this. The unit comes with Windows 10 S pre-installed. The upgrade process is relatively easy and quick to Windows 10 Pro (which is available through the windows store). The OS update process afterwards is not so. After updating finally finished, the laptop preforms perfectly fine. Its really quite responsive, however by no means is it ""fast"". The built in eMMC 32GB drive will have about 9.8GB left after Windows upgrade/updates and Office install.Have not figured out how to redeem the Office subscription, but I have Office 365 Personal anyways, so that didnt matter to me. You may want to find out how, though.Located on the bottom of the unit is actually a 2.5 bay for adding a second hard drive. Please be aware that its designed for a slim type drive. A standard 2.5 in drive will NOT fit. You'll end up bending the SATA controller on the motherboard up if you try to shove it in there. The SD card reader on the side is also a small gripe. The SD card does NOT push in all the way. It sticks out about 3/4"" from the laptop. Was kind of disappointed with this but the 2.5 bay kinda makes up for it.I opened the bottom of the laptop to see if there may also be an additional RAM slot, which I did not find from just popping off the bottom cover. IF there is one, it could be on the other side. Windows states theres 1 of 2 slots being used but it could be wrong.The CPU heatsink, for some reason (at least with mine), has a bit of Thermal Paste on top of it, which then touches the bottom cover of the laptop. This causes that spot to get rather uncomfortably warm.All in all, its a perfectly decent laptop for basic functions.

However, this is really good for surfing the internet, email & simple tasks that dont take a lot of horsepower.-The screen is OK  not great quality but Ive seen worse.-The speakers are just OK  not bad, but fine for YouTube or if youre not picky about sound.-Keyboard is comfortable & doesnt feel like youre typing on a miniature keyboard.-Not zippy fast but for simple tasks, it is fine.-No touchscreen.This would be perfect for my elderly mother-in-law. She only does email online, some surfing & this would be plenty for her use. Last year we bought her a laptop with lots of capability that she rarely uses  this would have been less expensive. Im using this Acer in my kitchen for checking email, online recipes & internet surfing  works great for that & Im not concerned about spilling a cup of coffee on an expensive laptop.",3,4,5,4,3

1727,"I have had this Chromebook for a little over a week now, and I must say that I am disappointed. First, let me state that the product itself is made of superb quality. The entire device is made of thin panels of aluminium, with the exception of the keyboard. However, my device came with ridiculous amount of flex within the bottom right side of the Chromebook. I figured this could be just mine, so getting a replacement could fix this. Secondly, the screen is great. It comes with the native resolution of 2400 by 1600, and can get as bright as 400 nits, which is beautifully amazing, BUT, I have found out that you cannot utilize this resolution due to the internal processing power being too week. It comes with Samsung's own ARM processor, which is a low voltage processor that would be better suited for a android tablet. Lastly, the most atrocious thing about this device is the keyboard. It is so godawful that I rather trash it and use this device in tablet mode only. The keys, for my sake at least, constantly got stuck and felt cheaper than a keyboard found on a sub $200 Chromebook.Pros--Good Build Quality-Best Screen I have seen on a Chromebook-2 in 1 functionality that works fairly wellCons-Terrible keyboard (seriously, I cannot stress enough on how bad it is)-ARM processor is weak and limits this device-$400 price tag is not justifiableAll in all, this device was very underwhelming to me. I have decided to return it. Thank the good Lord upstairs that Amazon is an amazing service that allows such actions.",2,4,5,4,5
1728,I had an old Samsung 5 550 and this is the newest version of that with many new features. The quality of the display is great and for the most part all the features I had on my old Chromebook work great.So far the tablet features are not very usable for me. The tablet seems to lag a lot when using the pen and scrolling g webpages is laggy as well I'm tablet mode. I don't use these features in general so it doesn't really matter much to me.The Android apps I tested seemed to run well. So this is why I gave it 4 stars.I suspect this will improve with updates over time.,2,4,5,4,5
1729,So far so good. Had to go to Acer and update the wireless lan driver to get it to work. But other than that its pretty smooth running. Pretty light and thin which is nice. All in all for $170 I'm not complaining. I did buy a slim 32gb flash drive for more storage that's basically 14gb emmc after operating system.,3,4,5,4,3
1730,"Excellent build quality. I have absolutely no reservations about the Surface Laptop. I think its better than the Surface Book I own. Microsoft got it right on this one.Positives: Fabric on top of the keyboard, quiet, all metal build, small and thin, fast.Note: I would suggest upgrading it to Windows 10 Pro from Windows 10 S. Its currently free to this at this time.",1,2,3,2,4

The HDD was running at a 100% usage while no foreground applications were running.I got it back 10 days later with the same problems after new HDD and a fresh installation of windows.Now I have to ship it back again for another 10 days.I need my computer. I cant just be without it. I even told the customer service rep that I will be giving them a bad review on social media With NO appeasements from them whatsoever. Its like they dont even care, all she said was OK. what???What kind of technicians dont check their work to see if the problem is fixed??? Really not impressed.A little background about myself.I have a college degree in software engineering. I know the ins and outs of computers. So when tech support advised me that the HDD is running at 100% because the Windows system is not updated on freshly installed OS, they cant be anymore-wrong. NOT on fresh installation of windows that is absolutely the idiotic.I have installed enough OSs in my life. The only reason Im not doing it myself is because I dont want to void the warranty.",2,2,1,2,2

1739,"Very fast device and lightweight, it is also very silent. I can hear no sound at all coming from it, I worked at the airport for a long time so it could be that, but definitively it is sound free or almost.Office and Windows work just fine, just activated the feature Find My Device in case of lost or steal.Keyboard is fine, just the right size, it doesn't feel small, and keys are very responsive, I would love to have an illuminated keyboard.Charger size is close to any other cellphone charger, which is really nice and easy to store, not the usual heavy laptop charger.Battery can last for several hours as advised, but that number gets reduced if you use it on maximum performance mode, of course.Something that really disappointing me is the color. It doesn't look gold at all, at normal sight. You have to literally compare it with another laptop that is grey or silver to notice the little (way too little) touch of gold that it has. Thanks Asus for making gold computers, just use deeper tone.----UPDATE----This computer keeps having issues reading my 1 TB Western Digital Drive, it keeps shutting it down. I have change settings for energy, and also on the USB controllers to do not power off the device, but it keeps doing it. The drive is working as usual in my HP work computer and in my Dell Desktop. Such a shame that this little thing is having that issue, I can't really watch anything from my drive because it gets disconnected in like 4 minutes, I have to save things to my documents first, but wait, I also don't have much space.I hope Asus can fix this issue with a driver update, I am an IT tech, and I can use the computer like this, I don't mind, but it shouldn't be like that. One star down.",3,1,5,4,3
1740,"Would be a great laptop, if it had come out of the box right. I ordered this item directly from dell, and when it arrived I was less than happy with the condition of my over $1,000 config of the device. First off I noticed that the hinge that holds the display onto the rest of the body of the machine was off-center, which caused there to be an overhang on the right side of the display. Then when I went to plug it in to boot it up - just to see if the display worked properly - I noticed the power brick's rubber belt for cable management was broken.Fortunately, Dell has pretty good customer service and a new one is on it's way. I'll update this review when I get the new one in about 8 days. I'm just glad I didn't need the thing now, otherwise I'd be a lot angrier right now...I didn't order this product from amazon, nor is this my config, but I'm posting this review here because these hardware and accessories issues could happen to any model of the 7000 series gaming.",1,0,1,2,2

1751,This is the absolutely worst computer...5 cents is too much to pay for it...the google controlled chrome system is pathetic. DO NOT BUY IT,2,2,5,4,2
1752,I have had multiple issues with this laptop.1. The laptop refuses to balance on all 4 of its rubber feet which makes it extremely hard to balance it on any flat surface without experiencing significant screen wobble.2. The OS crashed and refused to do a complete system restore.3. Experienced terrible wi-fi issues (Public Network only) which turned out to be a driver issue that corrupted after Windows launched the Fall Creators Update4. Terrible fan rattling noise which definitely felt like there was something pushing against it.Overall I personally have had a very bad experience with the laptop and returned both the original and the replacement orders,3,3,3,2,4

1760,"I really love this machine. I usually buy MSI products but this one seem much for geek oriented when it come to upgrading as it does not take someone with an engineering degree to do the simple things. Their GUI software utilities are good I only wish their BIOS screen was much more advanced like the MSI one is. Also, on the downside, I do not understand why they put a gaming computer SSDs in the RAID mode even if it is Raid 0. It is locked so as of last questioning of support you have to swap out the NVMe &/or M.2 and replace then to get rid of the Raid function which even a basic gamer like me could see that the speed tests were bottle necking there....also, support will tell you the max for the SSD cards is 512GB. That is not true as a simple Youtube search will show you that you can put a 1TB NVMe and 1TB M.2 in the machine and it works great and fast.Unfortunately though it worked right out of the box ..one of the spare Memory ports would not work, the mother board was not communicating with it. Finally had to send it back for a replacement....the saga continues and will update later on that.On the positive side, if you buy an acer be sure to join (its free) the ACER COMMUNITY. They had some great suggestions on seeing what the problem was and were able to come up with the much needed specs for the memory slots and what they are supposed to hold. shared that spec with Acer support as they did not seem to have those specs available.I dropped the rating by 1 star because of Acer's tech support...I should not have had to provide the memory slot specs for this unit to get them to double check and see that the memory slot should work.....also, they know they have a ""pink"" screen issue at boot up (annoying but not a biggy)...but mainly it was obvious after working a week with them much of their response was canned responses which I do not hold against them....Oh well, if you have an Acer again I highly recommend the Acer Community group.",2,0,1,0,1

This laptop ran into many troubles but luckily, I am an engineer so I know how to fix those.If you have intention of buying this laptop or already bought it, let me give you my thought on it:+ Always check for updates. Especially when you first run it.+ Even though this is a laptop, I dont think ""portability"" applies to it since it is heavy and the hinge is too weak.+ It will run into troubles, which certainly also happens to all other laptops. I have never owned any laptop that has no problem and thanks to that, I am so good at fixing both software and hardware problems.

Furthermore, the version of Windows 10 that is installed in this laptop is Windows 10 Home, which is not as good as Windows 10 Pro. I had to update to Windows 10 Pro by myself.

1813,Got this laptop from Costco. This has a 1050 with 4 gb of vram. Basically the 1050 time has a little bit more cuda core than the 1050. This has the 1050 chip in it with 4 gb of vram instead of 2. I don't care as it plays games great. The one issue I have is the control key. It's way to short for gaming. There's a full size one on the other side of the keyboard but not on the left.

1817,"I bought my first Acer Chromebook several years ago and loved it. I thought that I'd try another one but a larger one when the keyboard on my older, smaller model wore out (keys just stopped working). So I bought this. It's just ok. The battery life is good but I expected it to work faster than it does because it's supposed to have a faster processor speed. Occasionally, the machine slows down to a crawl and I'm not sure why. My biggest concerns: the quality of the machine and the price. There is a line that runs across the screen. I didn't notice it at first but there's a line that runs from one side of the screen to the other. It's more noticeable with the machine off than on but it upsets me that a refurbished unit would have the line. The other thing is that the overall feel of the machine is one of cheapness. My older machine was a solid little thing -- the new machine feels cheap. When I open the machine, the plastic creaks like it's not stuck together (glued? screwed?) properly. I also purchased the machine for a reasonable price then in the greatest Amazon tradition, the price dropped significantly. I requested a price match but was denied since the machine I bought came from one seller and the same machine for the less expensive price was from a different seller. I would not buy this machine again but would look for something different. Although the battery life seems better than my older, smaller machine, that's the only positive thing I see with this machine.",2,2,5,4,2
1818,"Everyone that's complaining of how slow it is needs to upgrade to an SSD. I've upgraded my previous laptops and desktops with SSD's but they have never been this dramatic of a overall speed increase. This machine is lightning with one. it's real easy to upgrade just search google and youtube. The included hard drive is the slowest 5400 rpm drive you can find, it's junk. Windows now boots in under 8 seconds. Very happy with the performance after upgrading to a relatively cheap PNY SSD. The A12 9720p is snappy and 8GB of ram is a nice amount for windows 10. Do yourself a favor and upgrade to an SSD immediately with the purchase of this one or you'll hate it like some other review's i've seen.",1,4,1,3,2

1822,"The best thing about this computer is the high quality screen - I love the rich detail. Overall, I do not like this computer. The odd sized screen makes it difficult to work in some back office programs because you can't edit some of the popup screens. The computer hardware (not intel) is very sluggish. I needed a workhorse and this computer just can't handle the amount of files I need opened at one time. Albeit, just word processing documents, but this machine is wigging out after only six months of use. It's started going through some flashing gyrations and adjusting the screen size every two seconds. Had to shut it down and let it rest. My last chromebook was an Acer C720. I loved it. It outperformed this computer when it was new by a long shot. Don't let the pretty packaging fool you. Also, this chromebook is so light that the laptop falls over when I try to type on it. I had to buy a case to hold it down so I could work on it. Also, I was disappointed with the stylus tool. Loved the fact that they have a place to store the pen. However, the only thing it writes on is the notepad. It won't write on the screen if I want to mark up documents, etc. It does work with drawing apps and of course you can use it with the touchscreen. Was expecting more. I also find that the touchscreen is not as responsive as I would like. Don't like the touch on the keyboard either. If you want a pretty machine for surfing and casual use, this is the machine for you. Otherwise, don't waste your money. I'm looking to replace this one as soon as I can.",2,4,5,4,5

Having the power button on the top right corner doesn't help either. And the worst part is definitely the loud and distinctive could whine.Thankfully for me, the specs and price of the laptop makes up for the downsides. So overall, I'm still quite happy with my purchase decision. If only the coil whine didn't exist, this laptop would've been the best I've used up to date.",3,2,2,0,3
1830,"OMG!!! I love it!! I researched all chromebooks for any entire week before making my decision on this one and it did not disappoint. The package was so light when it was delivered, that I thought that they sent me the wrong item. It could easily fit inside a woman's purse without issue. It's absolutely beautiful (but that's not the real reason it's so amazing). It's very fast and easy to set up. It instantly started when I opened it and had all of my forms, calendar, email, etc., from the moment I entered my Google email. It was set up in less than 5 minutes. It allows you to take a tour of the device right after setup, but honestly, it's so easy to use (especially if you already have a Samsung device) that it doesn't take long to figure any of it out. The speed is very swift and I can bounce from one thing to the next. My Wi-Fi was recognized immediately upon opening the device, which I've never seen happen with any other device (without prompting it first). I'm certain that it will slow down over time, as with any computer, but for now it's perfect. I love that it already has a large internal memory space, but what's even better is that it has the option for expandable memory (SD card slot- see photo) I am very pleased with my purchase and hope to get many years out of it.",2,4,5,4,5
1831,"TL:DR on bottomIt's a fantastic little laptop for students. It's super light weight, decent power, and has a long battery life (mine was used and still has a 13hr battery life). However, there are a few little kinks that prevent it from becoming a 5-star product. The first and foremost, when you are charging your battery it seems to have a noticeable impact on the processing power, for example, it's seamless when streaming 720p on YouTube, but when plugged in, it starts to have latency issues, and you will have to either wait until the video completely loads or go down to 480p. There was also an issue with my unit where the ""R"" key is slightly off, so if you press it in the wrong spot it wont register. Lastly, the memory is very small, so a flash drive is going to be mandatory. Other than that, its a super nice laptop. Clean, functional, quick, long battery and light (both in weight and brightness).TL:DR = Strongly suggest if you need a casual laptop for school, it's not a gaming laptop, and get a flash drive for it.",3,1,5,4,3

I can write pretty fast and there is noticable lag between the key i press and when it appears on the screen.Switching between some apps also shows serious framerate issues.The screen is just amazing, the keyboard is ok, the speakers doing their job, trackpack is ok, but as i mentioned, it's performance is just not sufficient for this price tag.I really recommend purchasing the Chromebook Pro, hopefully this will perform much better.",2,4,5,4,5

The battery lasts for 7 hrs and I usually dont charge it for two days bc I mostly use it for school work and only play one game on Steam. I don't really use it for heavy software, so I don't know how powerful it is for that.My main problem, though, is that sometimes the mousepad will stop working for a minute or two, or it will lag, but with my wireless mouse it's fine. It never lags or stops working. With the mousepad, I will try to right click but it will act like I intended to left click.

I would advise anyone purchasing this laptop to remove and/or inactivate all the Bloat-ware that comes with it-- ie; apps like the game, news, demo programs- they definitely slow it down... they slow'd it down enuff that watching stream'd media was nearly impossible. This is not the Acer's fault, for once I removed all that Win 10 junk, , the machine has been a dream. It would be nice if there was more memory- even with all the Bloat stuff removed, there is only 12GB's left to use.

1856,"Before you decide on this computer, you should figure out your needs. If youre looking for a powerful computer for gaming or to run a large business, youre looking in the wrong place. However, if you want a simple, yet reliable computer for basic office duties, internet browsing, and media (e.g. YouTube) at a great price, then look no further.On the plus side, it boots up quickly (due to the SSD). In addition, the WiFi card handles my high speed internet very well. Ive seen no issues while browsing the internet. In addition, the battery life is great.Depending on your needs, however, the negatives could be dealbreakers. First, the hard drive storage is downright miniscule at 32GB. And, at 4GB of RAM, there can be a lot of slowdown if youre multi-tasking. The speakers arent the best either.So, what is there thats redeeming about this computer? If your goal is gaming, even streaming, then just forget about it. The resolution and sound simply arent worth it.But, if youre a student or run a small business on a budget, its a good, inexpensive choice if you can get around the limitations. For example, if you choose Google Docs and use the cloud (or an SD card) for your storage this should be fine as a basic laptop in most instances.I gave it to my 9 year old as a starter laptop. She uses it for limited gaming, YouTube, and school projects via Google Docs. And, she can check her school email and class page.

I like the color look, and weight of the computer; it is very light weight and small enough to carry around. Like many people, I purchased this computer due to the fact, that it was cheap and I needed a computer quickly so that I can begin preparing for an exam. Overall, it is an okay computer, its not super fast, it does not have a touch screen, the power cord is short and it likes to only charge to 96%. Also, you cannot download anything on this computer, since receiving it in the mail, I have had to do a system reboot. Windows immediately started doing updates, and it slowed down the computer, to a point where I could barely open a webpage. Windows has like 6 updates upon immediately turning on this computer; its beyond ridiculous. There is not enough room on the hard drive to save all of these updates and keep the computer running smoothly, so I turned all updates off thanks to the help of a YouTube video. Another thing, this computer has a lot of pre-loaded applications; I'm not sure why, especially, since space is so limited. I took a picture of the menu page with all of the unnecessary applications, there are even more than that and the problem is that you cannot uninstall many of them. The only computer protection that is installed is Windows Defender, I have a McCafee subscription from the previous laptop, but I have chose to just stick to Windows Defender since there is not a lot of space on this computer. I definitely would recommend this computer if you are in a bind and need it to study for exam or complete business. It is very basic and for the price a pretty good deal. It is not perfect by any means, but when you are paying less than $300 for a computer you cannot expect to get a lot of memory, cool features, or a good webcam.

1871,"This is a punchy little laptop for its price that pleasantly surprised me in a lot of ways, and disappointed me in others. Part of my amazement with some of it probably has to do with the fact that my everyday workhorse laptop is a couple of years old, now. It certainly feels outdated next to this thing! I'll start with the good.* The laptop is REALLY light. When the box came, my husband didn't believe there could really be a laptop inside. He thought I was joking when I told him that's what it was. Weight doesn't honestly matter to me that much because I don't tote my laptop around, but if weight's an issue for you -- I really can't imagine laptops getting much lighter than this.* It turns on fast. Really fast. It has the OS on a solid state drive, and then a terabyte drive for storage, and the advantage to this is that solid state drives boot up super fast. This is a laptop that I'd have less of a problem with shutting down regularly, because turning it back on again takes about the same amount of time as it takes my laptop to come out of sleep mode. It's that fast.* It packs a fair amount of power without the heat. I've tested it on both Overwatch and Minecraft, and while it won't do either of those games at their best graphics settings (or even near-best), it does run them, and runs them smoothly. Moreover, it does so without producing a lot of heat, which surprised me. I have ordered a fancy chill pad to go with this laptop, since I anticipate it's going to be doing a lot of playing games with high graphics requirements, but I'm not seeing a lot of heat issues, even without it.* I thought the whole 'thin bezel' thing was silly until I saw this laptop's screen. It really does make my old laptop's screen seem outdated and clunky.* The speakers are decent, for what they are. They don't have much of a bass, but they did bring out some things in the other registers of the music I was listening to that impressed me. If you just want 'thump, thump, thump', they're not the speakers for you, But they might hold up okay, for music that has a little more than that going on.* Battery life was pretty decent. My roommate played Overwatch for hours on it and didn't realize that it wasn't plugged in.Now the bad:* This is the biggest concern I have with this laptop: The charger gets REALLY hot, and the wire itself seems flimsy. Between the hot charger and the flimsy wire, I'm expecting that my charger isn't going to last long. This isn't something I'm terribly comfortable leaving plugged in and walking away, either.* It comes with a lot of bloatware which you then have to go through and uninstall, which is kindof a pain. I don't get why companies do this. Also, it tries to push McAfee on you. I don't know why companies do this, either.* The speakers, while decent, could be better. But I've been saying that about my laptops for years, and have yet to own one where they ARE better. Still, when my iPhone has better sound, it feels like there's room for improvement.* Given how light and thin it is, I'd actually be a little afraid to tote this thing around too much without some kind of really protective case. It seems like it could get damaged too easily.",2,2,1,2,2

Very little bloatware (almost none, really) The ASUS utilities do NOT come pre-installed, they come on a DVD. Updated versions of the apps are also easily acquired via the support website.2. Laptop looks and feels great considering it's a plastic shell and not aluminum.

It is a matte screen, so don't expect the high glass look of a tablet, definitely low degree of viewing angle for peak contrast. (ASUS has a display app for this PC called ""Splendid"" you can install from support that lets you customize in detail the screen color). Along with Intel HD Graphics control, works great, attached picture.7. ASUS Remote Link App for Android Google Play that lets you control the computer, mouse, media playlists, powerpoints, sleep, restart, logoff. remotely via wi-fi or bluetooth. Forget to shut off your PC as you leave the office? Open App, shutdown remotely.8. FULL size Keyboard! The keys are full size, with proper gaps between them. People with large fingers won't have any trouble with this layout.9. Battery life! Even on balanced mode, out of the box getting 10 hours (Screen shot included). probably longer on power save mode. The CPU really does throttle its mhz on the fly as needed, I've seen it go from 900 mhz up to 2.7 ghz, but mostly stay around 1.9 ghz when idle.Negatives1. 1 TB 5,400 RPM hard drive really is super slow, 2010 slow, but that's what you should expect. I knew that when i bought it. I will be upgrading to an SSD once a proper sale comes along.2. Not a lot of accessories for this P Series. Would have liked the option to buy a hard drive slot for the CD/DVD slot to add a 2nd hard drive. Maybe even a 2nd battery bay drive. If someone knows a recommendation one, please let me know.3. Why a White ASUS on the lid? Why not black like on the keyboard?4. The speakers are definitely weak. the speakers are located under the chassis and really only give vocal range frequencies, but only can be used in quiet rooms. However, who doesn't have headphones or bluetooth speakers these days? really not a big deal since this is a business laptop.I definitely recommend this laptop, especially for people who love to pick a custom SSD drive upgrade later from their favorite vendor.DVD drive sounds like a small fan on your desk at high speed. If you're watching a DVD without headphones or speakers, I could see it being an issue, but who does that now?",2,2,1,2,2

However, compared to the Macbook Pro (2012) that I used to use for gaming (yes, really), this thing is a piece of crap.- Pathetic CPU performance. Want to listen to music on Spotify or Youtube while gaming? Forget it. Having open any other program other than your game will fix the CPU at 100%.- Real-time audio is garbage due to buffer underruns from other drivers. If you do manage to play music (or any sound for that matter), it will be occasionally punctuated by ear-piercing pops and clicks.- Unreliable internet; default web browser is IE, and boy does it suck. However, Chrome (which I switched to soon after purchasing) is only marginally faster for some reason. I find it better to use another computer if I want stable web browsing.-Battery cord disconnects easily due to its weight. Just a minor annoyance.These problems are new to me after switching from my old mac, and it makes me wonder why I didn't just invest in a better laptop.If you are considering purchasing a satisfactory gaming laptop, I strongly urge you to consider spending a few hundred more on a better device that will be worth your patience.

1889,"This computer is amazingly light. Honestly I was shocked the first time I picked it up, it's that light. It's amazing that they can fit such a well performing large screened laptop and have it be this light. The screen is beautiful. Hardly any bezels too so it's pretty much all screen. The keyboard is nice and comfortable with a nice clickiness, not mushy like others. The trackpad is very responsive. Just as good as any other laptop I have used, including Macs. The specs are spot on for probably 90% of people. The 8th gen i5 is the brand new 2018 processor and it's fast! 8 gig of ram is more than enough for your average user. 256gb SSD hard drive is fast and a good size, I would say it's more than enough space for the normal casual user. Tons of ports including the most current usb-c. While I have not run any ""tests"" on the battery life it seems pretty insane. LG quotes 19 hours and I have been getting that and a little more even. It's nice to be able to not have ""plug anxiety"" and always have to worry about being near a plug for power. So far this laptop has powered through literally everything I have thrown at it. I installed Office 2016 and it handles excel, word, powerpoint, etc. with ease. I typically have a lot of tabs open while I'm browsing and it has never slowed down. I love watching Netflix on the large high def screen. Overall a super laptop for a great price that will meet the needs of 90% of users. Highly recommended!",3,2,3,2,2

I bought this for the whole family to share around the house. We keep it in the living room and switch between profiles as needed quickly and easily. The kids use it for school assignments. I use it to cast up to the TV and just basic web searches and what not. This Operating System is brilliant. Everything runs quickly and well. It just works. This machine could really put a dent in the Windows and Mac world. Those machines still have value for productivity beyond email/web/docs, but the gap is closing, and this Chromebook is much easier to use. You will love it.

Hence, if you can endure some research time to find out why somethings are not working well, then you could setup this laptop to its optima best to get the best out of it.As I noted above, I'm still getting used to it but it has been okay thus far.",1,0,1,2,2
1904,"Can't quite attest to the battery life yet, but the bugger took forever to charge, and it was nearly empty out of the box, so that says something. I've got brightness on the screen almost to max, Word, Excel, Firefox, and Chrome open, as well as the usual background mess of integrations, bluetooth and wifi on etc, and it's estimating 9 hours. I'm inclined to believe it. If I can get through my entire workday (I literally do not leave the computer, I work a solid 10-12 hours a go), that will be a commendable record.It's extremely snappy. Loading tabs on browsing, loading complicated spreadsheets with scripts and scrolling pages, it all works fine. Connected to my gaming PC and streamed some Doom 2016 and Half Life 2 just to see how that would work out, and it does very well with some noticeable but acceptable lag (though I needed to switch to 5G band). Don't expect e sports over wifi, kids. Haven't tested any gaming running on the actual hardware, but I would think it's pretty garbage for any graphically intense games. Not going to be a great one for that, but that's not the purpose here. 1080p youtube and netflix runs and looks great with no tearing or other visual noise, so hard to complain there, the IGPU is doing well enough for that.There aren't a ton of ports, but what's there is good enough. Running my SteelSeries Rival 100 because I refuse to sacrifice on mouse quality. The trackpad is fine and will do well enough on something like an airplane ride, and I appreciate the ability to right click. Tried charging through the USB C port and can report that it prevented the PC from dying, though it recommended I plug in something with 10W or higher rating in order to actually charge the machine, so I may try that out. With the computer almost dead, I went to bed and the USB-C had charged it by the morning, so it certainly works when it's not drawing power. Good to know I probably won't have to depend on the proprietary charger if it goes bad or gets damaged.The inclusion of Bluetooth and Wireless makes it pretty easy to hook up plenty of externals, and my 60% mechanical bluetooth keyboard worked swimmingly. I really thought I would need it for this machine, but to be honest, if you're trying to incognito type a bunch of notes while you're on calls with clients, this keyboard is a hell of a lot quieter, and is honestly kind of incredible. There's a satisfying punch on the keys, and they seem spaced and sized well. The throw on the keys is obviously very short, but you do get the feeling you're typing and not just touching a flat surface. Feels just as good as the Macbook Pro. I'm a very large person and it's working out for me. I'm a solid 90wpm on a variety of mechanical keyboards, and my first ten runs with this thing were frankly ridiculous: I keyed in at just shy of 101. It's a great keyboard, and I think I might just have to leave the 60% for longer trips when I know I'll want to use the laptop more as a desktop than anything else. I will be adding a numerical mechanical bluetooth keypad because of my data entry needs, but this little guy will do amazingly well for the glut of emails and notes I have to take throughout a day.The screen is great. Not as good as the MacBook, but close enough for work that it doesn't mater. Off axis viewing is is true to color and you'll be able to collaborate on a screen if need be. The size takes almost full advantage, beveling is super small and looks great. I got mine in the white finish because the silver wasn't available, and I'll deal with that because it was cheaper. I don't do any sort of content creation or color work, but everything looks pretty great, almost up to snuff with my desktop monitor. No, you don't get the density of other laptop screens, but brightness is acceptable and color and contrast are great, and the 1080p panel scales well and keeps the battery life going.To be honest, it feels like a lightweight version of the MacBook Pro. The build quality isn't quite up to that snuff, but it is very solid, I'm sure it will hold up nearly as well, and I'll take the weight tradeoff since the warranty is so cheap. You don't get the same peripherals, but to be honest almost nobody actually uses all those freaking Thunderbolt ports, can we all stop pretending? The company wanted to get me into one of those, but I really don't like their ecosystem or their interface. Apple has just never been as intuitive for me as it seems to be for everyone else. Anyway, since every dollar I spend eventually comes out of my paycheck, I wanted to find something reasonable that would last through a long flight with snappy performance and wouldn't make me look like a teenager with a gaming laptop. Grabbing a Macbook of any sort was going to be another 1-2000 dollars, and the performance would have been identical.I guess that's kind of the thing here. If you need something that actually gets real work done, looks professional, is incredibly lightweight and compact, and won't need to be plugged into the wall all day, this is as good as it gets in this price point. You can spend twice as much for the exact same hardware specs and a prettier screen with that sweet Apple logo, but you'll be laughing with the extra thousand dollars you have in your pocket when some Jobs acolyte is looking for a wall charger and you've still got 30%.",3,2,3,2,4

Ive had this PC for 3 months now and I cant play any demanding games without the CPU maxing out to 100% and causing major shuddering. This did not happen at first but now games like GTA5 have a 60% GPU usage and 100% CPU. Usually the bottleneck is the GPU but for some reason its the CPU on this PC.

I called Asus and they said to send this one back. I ordered from a 3rd party seller so I may try directly from Amazon and get a cooling pad.First, I am a World of Warcraft gamer. I did a good amount of research on laptops. I am coming from a Lenovo Y700 15-ACZ. I chose this laptop because a) it was recommended by my gamer friends to get an Asus b) the larger SSD is good for the OS and the game since they are both large files. I also wanted the speed from the SSD c) sacrificed on the 1060 graphics but the 1050 is much higher than what I have now and looks great d) the keyboard is awesome!!! No more boring red keys. I checked this out at a best buy store before I purchased.Update after 2 weeks of use: Graphics are beautiful on the 1050 (I do not regret not spending the extra $$ for 1060 graphics). Loading screens are so fast and the game refreshes so much faster!! Trackpad is better (although I use a mouse). Took getting used to the font on the keyboard but that took just a couple of days. Big upgrade from my Lenovo. I did experience my keyboard/mouse locking up for a few seconds in WoW during a mythic+ but I think this had to do with the overlay from Discord or having to update the driver (went to geforce's website-- here you can download their program and optimize based on your game). The battery isn't the greatest but I don't mind since I play near an outlet and I'm not sure how much battery someone could expect out of a gaming laptop anyway.

1943,"It's hard to get excited about this machine because it's built to meet very basic expectations at a very low price point. I don't know how it compares to laptops selling at the same price or less but I for one am astounded at how much value there is at the price.The top of the laptop is black textured plastic. It's textured kind of like a fabric weave and looks like it will resist scratches, probably better than metal tops do. Overall it is surprisingly light and thin. It has molded raised feet on the bottom that are about 1/8"" thick. Without those it would be even thinner but they probably help with cooling.I could complain about the limited memory and processor speed but I won't because this thing is faster and has almost as much memory as a laptop I used until 2011 which I paid over $1000 for. Considering how cheap plug-in memory is these days (and getting cheaper) it's easy to spend between $20 and $100 and get additional memory from a 32gb usb up to a 1000gb external usb drive.Even though external memory is cheap, this laptop won't win any races rendering video and probably won't run a lot of games at a satisfactory speed. If all you need to do is poke around on the internet, word processing and basic photo editing type things however it is very adequate. It also comes with Windows 10 for the price of some laptops which run free operating systems. I've been using Windows 10 for over a year now and find it mostly trouble free and intuitive.The keyboard and mousepad are unimpressive but serviceable.While I do think this is a great value, you could easily spend a little more and get a laptop that looks and feels nicer and has more onboard memory.",3,4,5,4,3
1944,"Last I checked, my new computer was due to arrive tomorrow 7/6 and was delighted to see it come in the mail a day early on 7/5. It was packaged very securely. No damage could have possibly happened while it was being shipped. It's in perfect condition as described and set up was really easy. It came with a free trial for Microsoft Office, which is awesome.I am a 31 year old mom, college student, and writer. I wanted something small and lightweight that I could bring with me in the living room for when I'm cramming in last minute homework or find inspiration for my novel, but don't want to leave my family to work on any of it. It's really perfect for that purpose. I haven't had a chance to explore what else I will find it useful for, but I am guessing it will be tons of things.Set up was really simple. It was out of the box at 2:14 and by 2:25 I was beginning my typical 'new computer downloads', like Chrome and all of that.Also, the color looks like a dull blue in the photo, which I wasn't pumped about, but it's really a bright fun blue and I like it a lot. In contrast with the bright white keyboard it looks really sharp.For this price, the product is more than I expected. Highly recommend.",2,2,5,4,6

1948,"I purchased this laptop for my wife, who was looking primarily for an internet machine with maybe some light Office use. She also wanted something small, so the 11.6"" size fit the bill.I have been working with computers since the early 90s (both PC and Apple), so I know my way around a machine.Build Quality: For the price, I can't really complain. It looks sharp, and the overall quality of materials used seems to be great. The keyboard feels pretty good, and the trackpad works great. I'm a huge Macbook fan, and the gestures for scrolling on the Asus trackpad are very nice.Performance: The 4gigs of memory along with the CPU makes Windows 10 move very smoothly. Day-to-day use of Chrome and other apps works great. Everything is quick to load. The wireless card never loses connectivity, and it zips around the internet just fine.Small HD: It should not be a surprise to anyone that orders this that it only comes with a 32 gig drive. Yes that is small, but it's not a big deal if you aren't installing tons of apps or saving lots of media. Many people complain that after Windows 10 updates, they have no room left. I found that I had less than 2 gigs free after all updates. HOWEVER... you need to run disk cleanup. Win 10 leaves a lot of update files laying around. After you delete this junk, I was up to 12 gigs free. 12 gigs free is plenty for my wife, and she can always utilize an online service to store more or pop in a micro SD card.Display: We've tried Netflix and some HD movie trailers on Youtube so far. They look great to us. There are no issues with the laptop keeping up with the video, and the little 11.6 display has a nice look to it with HD material. We aren't talking 4k quality here, but it's better than expected for the size and price.Overall, this laptop is great. The price is great, and I've enjoyed using ASUS products for years with no issues (mostly motherboards).You won't regret this purchase. Just make sure you do some basic maintenance on it to tweak its performance and storage.",3,1,5,4,3

I chose to have them from the app store so as not to ""clog up"" the browser.It will connect with my Sandisk wireless usb, uploading and downloading easily.(although ive been chastized for this because apparently it doesnt allow that, go figure! Some people!) But. I cannot download images from my cameras to the chromebook wirelessly, again, go figure.

1964,"Fresh out of the box and it's running incredibly slow. I must have gotten a bad one (as did many reviewers it seems), as the computer specs are decent and plenty of reviewers say it runs fast. As is, I am currently running Google Chrome and nothing else and even that is absurdly slow.Checked task manager and was at 80-90% CPU usage and 70+ memory- running just a web browser! Unacceptable. Try to run more than 3 tabs and it's game over. Something ain't right.",3,1,5,4,3
1965,"I love the Chromebook as a whole. The keyboard is decent, the screen is great. Being able to flip in tablet mode is awesome. All that was great until....... Wifi connection started dropping. In the beginning, I could reset the wifi, and it would work fine. Then it turned into restart the device, and finally, it just wouldn't connect at all. So, I sent it off for repair from Samsung (they do have pretty good customer service I must admit.) They checked it out, and repaired it (apparently replaced the whole motherboard) I get my new one back, and for two weeks it is great, then.... the same issue. I am waiting for my second repair, and crossing my fingers that it is fixed this time. This issue is the only thing about the device that has been a problem, aside from the metal scratching easy, but that is not a huge issue for me.",2,4,5,4,5

1967,"It works, it's a PC, the battery life seems to be great, but it's incredibly slow for most things. Maybe I'm a bad judge because I've been on Macbook Pro's for years now, but even web browsing just feels slow. It has a great exterior finish visually, but it IS a still plastic, so it doesn't FEEL great. The display opens flat, I'm not sure when you'd ever want your laptop to be flat, but I guess it can do it... it unfortunately doesn't open ALL the way 360 degrees though",3,4,5,4,3

It's light though which is great.I'd say this is worth more like $300 tops.,2,4,5,4,5
1970,"I bought this laptop as an emergency replacement when my $800+ Windows laptop died right before college finals week. Several months later, I'm still using this as my main laptop. While frustrating with the lack of access to certain favorites (Photoshop, Illustrator, The Sims 4, etc), it's a sturdy and sleek laptop with fast load times that can handle a lot of tabs, etc. For a mid-end Chromebook, it's probably my favorite model. The convertible factor and touch screen are only nice additions that only sometimes come in handy.",2,4,5,4,5

I will not judge the actual item based on my poor experience with Amazon.This laptop is great. I took naturally to the touchscreen, but you can function on the laptop without the touchscreen (I realize some people do not like to ""ruin"" the screen). Some things may bother you though.NO CD ROM. I lucked out in that I could download all the previous apps I had, but if you require a CD, you will need to buy an external CD ROM drive to run the apps, and to burn CD's.ONLY 1 USB PORT. So I had to buy a splitter. Personally bought it to be able to use a mouse and keyboard, although I find it comfortable typing on the laptop's keyboard.Overall, I've had it for over a month and I love it. No major problems, very fast so long has you have a decent internet condition. I have a lot of apps and files that I transferred with no problem and the computer is still running great.",0,2,3,2,4

The keyboard is good (though not excellent--but keyboard feel is subjective), the screen is first-rate, and the touchpad is just fine (though not close to my gold standard in CB touchpads: the Dell 13"").However, potential buyers should note that the CB Plus (v. 59 stable channel) appears to have really hard time with less than optimal WiFi reception. If I move close the the AP, the speeds are as expected (50-60 Mbps). If I move into the next room, however, speeds drop to about 20 Mbps (still perfectly usable (signal strength is 44)). I get similar results on 5G and 2.4G (slightly better with 2.4G, probably owing to slightly better signal strength (mid 40s-50s on 2.4G, compared to about 40 on 5G)). When a Bluetooth mouse is connected to the CB Plus, WiFi DL speeds drop to about 10 Mbps.My Asus C302c (v. 60 beta channel), on the other hand, has no such problems: speeds at these two locations are consistent at 50-60 Mbps. Reported signal strengths are slightly higher on the C302c: 58 compared to 51 on 2.4G.",2,4,5,4,5

It boots rather fast, windows 10 works just fine, and it runs youtube, surfs the web, and runs Netflix for the kids just fine.

2013,"Chromebook Plus Review 2.0Opening: Overall great device that could be priced more at the 399.99 mark rather than 449.00 it usually goes for. Below is the pros, neutral, and cons.Pros: Thin and light (only 2.4 lbs). Beautiful display (2400 x 1600). 2 in 1 device. Chrome OS is easy to use, and has android apps. Includes pen, that is stored in case. Performance and battery life are good.Neutral: Keyboard is just average, feels kinda mushy when typing. Speakers-have to be turned almost all the way up to get best performance. Weird looking in laptop mode (screen is tall). Feels odd in tablet mode (can feel the keys in the back).Cons: Couldn't think of anything so Im going with price. At 449.00 ( I bought mine at 419.00) it is too expensive when compared to some of the windows hybrid offerings which can have better performance and the full windows experience on a 2 in 1 device.Competition: I feel this device is better than the tablet first offerings from Apple (Ipad pro), google pixel, Lenovo Yoga book. The competition against windows hybrids is more tight as there are 2 in 1s in the same price range that have more power (maybe not the battery life).Conclusion: I have used mostly windows devices but this chromebook plus is a keeper for me as its dual tablet/laptop modes and its ability to use android apps with chrome os put it above the others.",2,4,5,4,5

2043,"Got this computer (512 gb SSD, 16 gb RAM) a day ago and it's pretty much everything I wanted and more. Has all the ports I need for school with the power to play games whenever I have extra time. I haven't really dealt with the display too much because I use an external monitor but from what I've seen so far the display is pretty decent.The only gripe I have is that the fans get fairly loud when you're working the CPU too hard but other than that it's been a great purchase. I got the ASUS equivalent about half a month back and was incredibly unsatisfied with that laptop. You are definitely making a great choice in getting this one.",1,0,1,2,2
2044,"it an excellent computer, but sometimes it lags (maybe thats the correct term),",1,0,1,2,2
2045,"This is one of those ""for the price"" reviews. Don't order unless you know that this little lappy can meet your needs. If you know it'll work though, it's a slam dunk. I got mine for the price of the 2gb version, and I can't help but wonder if it was a fluke that Asus built some like this. The 4gb RAM makes up a little for the capable, but modest processor. For MS Word, Google Docs, and Adobe Reader use, it's been flawless. It seems like the big website reviews complain about the low-power chips while trying to use multiple video streams and 13 browser tabs. Obviously don't do that. You won't have a problem with basic Netflix though - even though it's not an ideal machine for that (see screen comments below). It's more than capable of non-gaming, non-graphic or video production taks. It also runs an external monitor nicely. That functionality is baked in to the GPU on the Atom chip. It doesn't even flinch.The battery life is what it says on the box. Great. It's like that old flip phone you used to have that you didn't have to charge every day.The only thing I dislike about it is the screen. It's a rather dim TN panel. While I haven't run into any issues with the viewing angles, and I can make it out when I need to, it's still a bit of a letdown. I would have paid another $50 for a nicer panel. Regardless, it meets every need that I have for word processing and research in grad school, and it's cheap, small, and tough enough to throw in my bag on my way out the door. Absolutely would recommend. It's not my only computer, but it would serve in a pinch.Pro tip: keep an eye out for ""used"" deals from Amazon Warehouse. That's how I got mine without a multi-month wait. Brand new. In a sealed box. Works like a champ.",3,1,5,4,3

The back lighting is not easy to see, and if it is running on battery, the keyboard turns off completely. Virtually impossible to see the letters in the dark. I would also appreciate being able to change the color from red to almost any other color. I erroneously thought it might be configurable, but alas, you are stuck with red. Very nice screen, and the sound is pretty good, too. Very solid feeling. Very good cooling capability, as well.",2,0,3,2,2
2051,This computer is the slowest and most terrible computer I have ever used. I have owned it for several months and had problems with it for the beginning. It literally took 3 hours for it to download everything it needed to get set up which is insane. It also had a faulty keyboard and the speakers were messed up. About a month ago it got the blue screen of death due to some configuration issues but luckily I'm still under manufacturer warranty so I'm sending it out to Asus hoping they send me something different. I'm also lucky my boyfriend got an Hp computer for me to use for school which by the way only took a few minutes to get set up and has been working really well so far it also saved my life because as a college student you can't go without a computer for long!,2,0,1,2,2
2052,"It's very nice looking computer. The screen is sharp and the back lit keys are nice. It came with allot of bloatware. It periodically freezes upand sometimes loads slow. I never know when this is going to happen.. It's really a problem when I have to write an email report for my work and it does this. If I can't send a simple email when I need to, what good is it.

Microsoft states they won't provide updates past April 30, 2018 for this version of Windows 10 and they suggest downloading the updates. Well, not happening. I deleted Chrome, all games, any apps not used daily and still not enough memory available. Thinking strongly of sending this laptop back.",3,2,5,4,3
2055,More then I expected for the price. Worth every penny I spent. Fast for searching the web and quality screen display. Able to move between screens smoothly without delay.,3,1,5,4,3
2056,"I want to say that Acer has done extremely well in marketing what is essentially a mid-range gaming computer for a very good price point indeed. Including shipping, I was able to get this machine for about $725 all told, which is an excellent for a computer with a quad core i5 and a 1050Ti; other machines with identical specifications retail for upwards of 900 dollars.I have yet to be disappointed; I've thrown almost all of the best games I have, including Gaijn's War-Thunder (2013) and Idea Factory's Cyberdimension Neptunia (2017) at this computer, and it handles them almost flawlessly at 1080p on maximum settings; in Cyberdimension Neptunia, which uses the Unreal 4 engine, there are a few hiccups down to 57fps when new effects come into play, but otherwise the system holds stead with barely any noticeable noise or heat; Warthunder never drops below about 77FPS. This is the machine you want if you want a budget gaming laptop that truly lives up to the advertising hype; the Nvidia GTX 1050Ti will be able to handle most items coming out within the next few years on medium-high settings at 1080p for at least the next 3-5 years.With that said, the computer gets four rather than five stars for a couple of reasons. First, because while the chassis is solid and well made, the IPS screen itself is a bit dim, and the plastic frame for it feels a bit fragile; it's certainly not made of as durable a material as the actual chassis. Second, because the audio seems a bit off; while this is a function of the extra subwoofer/ bass settings they seem to have added to the audio card, it makes the audio a bit less clear than on my older computer, an HP Envy 17 S143CL model, which was purchased for $800 in December 2016.",2,0,3,2,2

This is 3:2 ratio and movies are widescreen so it just did not feel right. Too bad, because th screen itself looks great.The keyboard is crammed and feels cheap. Not backlit either.Terrible speakers.The body itself is terrible. I expected nice, sturdy aluminum body similar to a macbook. It is like a cheap plastic.The computer was not as responsive as I hoped while I was using it. A spent over an hour using it because I was trying to convince myself to buy it. I just couldn't, it was just not worth it.I ended up going with the Asus C302. It feels more premium and is better in every way (except for the screen resolution).",2,4,5,4,5

2085,This Chromebook is a home run . The screen is sharp for text and the battery life is great . It is fanless which for me is a must. 90% of the time I use this it on my lap . Web pages scroll nicely and having several windows open is not a problem. Plays you tube videos without a hiccup. Bottom of the unit gets a little warm under stress but is never hot or uncomfortable. These are issues which would be of less concern if you use it on a desktop. Wifi reception is also excellent and the sleep wake-up cycle when opening and closing the lid is quick and picks up wifi instantly which was sometimes an issue on a Macbook AIr I had owned. Sound is better than average and while I have seen complaints about the keyboard I have no issues with it. In the past I have substituted stick on letters for backlit keys but the screen on this unit is so bright I don't need them . My No 1 complaint on the previous laptops I have owned has always been the touchpad but this one is perfect for me. The touchscreen is also excellent and does better on a Chromebook than a Windows based laptop. My previous laptop was an HP with a detachable screen and it was always a bit glitchy . The ability to flip the screen and use it sitting on a counter in the touch mode is convenient as well. Having a dedicated volume control on the side of the unit is also convenient and a feature most other units don't have. The touch pointer is also easy to use and stores conveniently in the unit. Power supply is light and compact and the usb c plug in in goes in either way so no more fumbling in the dark for charging . The whole time I have been writing this I was trying to think of something I don't like about the Samsung CP and the answer is .........nothing.,2,4,5,4,5

Very poor product. Technical support not much better. there was a problem with the numbers pad it kept acting like the mouse. and tech help could do nothing to solve the problem. I finally figured it out my self while waiting ten minutes for the girl in the Philippines to ask how to solve the mystery when all it was is a easy access setting found in the control panel. so frustrated my mom bought one and no issues I decide to take the leap to Lenovo and now I regret it.

It is the most piercing singular source of frustration I have ever experienced with any electronics. It's garbage.

The battery life is awesome, way better than my last laptop. This laptop is very lightweight and portable.Only bad things; One month after having it the videos stopped playing and i was getting error messages. Long story short, I needed to update my sound drivers and now it is working fine. The other thing is left clicking on the mouse pad isn't the best, but it works. This is easily solvable by getting a wireless mouse. All in all, I would definitely recommend this laptop, especially over the others that I have had and used.",1,4,1,2,2

2115,"This is an excellent laptop for gaming, basic productivity, or even some coding for a Comp Sci/Technology student. It has a bright, somewhat color-accurate IPS display, a nicely spaced, back-lit keyboard with very quiet keys for typing, and of course the beasty combination of a 7th gen Core i5 processor, a GTX 1050 Ti GPU, and 8 GB of RAM to keep it all humming nicely. This is of course considered and ""entry level"" platform for a serious PC gamer, but this isn't really for a serious PC gamer is it? Just for reference I am coming from a Lenovo IdeaPad y410p with an intel i7-4700MQ processor, a GT 755M GPU and also 8 GB of RAM, and that is a really nice mid-tier gaming laptop from about 5 years back and a great machine. Though the cheaper i5 included with this machine is still outstripped, power-wise, by my 5 year old i7 (with hyper-threading) the overall build of this budget acer gaming PC absolutely destroys everything else on the Lenovo performance-wise. The newer i5 is neck and neck with the i7, but the ""budget"" GTX 1050 Ti with 4 GB of VRAM (vs. the GT755M 2 GB VRAM) and 256 GB SSD make a gigantic difference in how games load and play.Why do I call this ""Gamer Lite""? Well because this laptop really only comes with the bare minimum required for a PC gamer. You only get a 256 GB SSD, and 8 GB of RAM. The real excellent upgrade is the GTX 1050 Ti GPU, which is freakin stellar for a PC priced under $1000 USD. Basically, you get everything you need to run most AAA titles at High settings, ON A LAPTOP THAT COSTS $750 USD! 256 GB isn't gonna give you a lot of space for a huge library (obviously) but the fact that it is solid state makes it so quick. Win 10 boots in seconds. Steam opens literally instantly. Instantly! Not exaggerating. Kiss those long load times goodbye.I did a lot of research before I decided on this laptop, and there are a few reviewers (YouTube and website reviews) out there talking a lot about heat. It is true, this particular laptop doesn't have the best design for cooling, but it is totally fine for normal use. I mean if you want to run a AAA title on Ultra settings for several hours then yeah, your CPU and GPU are gonna get hot and start to degrade. But this thing isn't for that. That's what a maxed out gaming tower with 10 fans and liquid cooling is for. Go buy that if that's what you want to do. I've seen external heat tests on this thing that look totally in line with what you would want from a performance laptop. If it gets hot then that means its time to go outside and talk to people LOL.Honestly, great value for an excellent setup. Not the best. Not even by far the worst. At this price point your options are quite limited but this is really the best bang for your buck. And also, pretty nice to use just as a PC.",2,0,3,2,2

The apps are good, and work perfectly on an Android device. They just don't work right on this device. It sucks when you load up an app and then can't do anything but restart because the app doesn't provide a menu. I was hoping for a portable device that would be easier to manage than a smart phone, particularly for things that require lots of keyboard activity. The Chromebook isn't it.

2128,"Got super excited about buying the new Surface laptop and the excitement pretty much ended as soon as I took it out if the box. I won't talk about the lack of USB-C ports, or the longevity of the Alacantara surface material because Tech. websites cover that in detail. I will give you my personal everyday user experience:So opening the laptop is not easy, by easy I mean i should not be struggling to open the screen when I supposedly bought the laptop with the ebst design in the market. There is no hinge, or a little gap for you to slide your thumb in to open the damn thing.The laptop moves around a lot when placed on even slightly polished surfaces. I was at a local coffee shop and it kept moving as I was typing.I could not even connect to the WiFi at the coffee shop. I clicked on the network and it kept trying to connect me for the next 5min. Finally, after looking up an article about this problem with Surface laptop on my Iphone, I had to RESET my Wifi settings on my new laptop for it to work. It's 2017, and this is not acceptable for a machine this expensive or any tech. product no matter the cost.The screen colors are not something I am familiar with. I haven't looked too much in to that but the display has a very unfamiliar shade of white that I am not used to.The laptop is not Up-gradable, meaning 2-3 years in to the future when you decide to upgrade the RAM or storage, you can't. That's a big setback because laptops slow down with time and not being able to upgrade it will cost you well A NEW LAPTOP.So it's been about 2 days since I've had this and the day I started using it, in about 3 hours I had already ordered a Refurbished Macbook Pro, 13"" Oct 2016 release date(Same Price). Now, I am just waiting for that lovely piece of machinery to show up at the Apple store so I can return this sad attempt at recreating the Macbook by my neighbors in Seattle.",1,2,3,2,4

2155,"For a sub-$1,000 gaming laptop, this is about as good as it gets. The specs seemed too good to be true, but they are. Just about all aspects of it are great, from the display to the backlit keyboard, et cetera. There are handy raised icons on the Escape, S, F, J, Delete, and Down Arrow keys that are unique to each other and make it easy to quickly find where you are on the keyboard. The function keys are dual purpose, and have mute, volume up/down, brightness up/down, et cetera. The backlighting on the keyboard can be adjusted to a lower brightness and even turned completely off. As far as performance goes, it hasn't had a single problem so far on any of the games I've been playing, even on high settings. I also found that it performs faster when plugged in rather than on battery. Keep this in mind as it will increase FPS and all general processing speeds. Access to the internal components is very simple, achievable by undoing a single screw to remove a panel covering most of the bottom of the laptop. I've installed a 2 TB HDD and 8 more GB of RAM, and had no problems doing either. Disclaimer: it ONLY accepts DDR4 RAM, so keep that in mind if you want to upgrade it. The battery is user-replaceable, and while I've seen people say it lasts any certain amount of hours, for me, it usually lasts about 3 hours if I'm gaming and around 5 for normal tasks. Since I'm generally at home and keep it plugged in anyway, it's a moot aspect. The subwoofer being on the bottom has made absolutely no difference to me, since I always listen to audio through headphones, so any drawback there really depends on if you're going to listen without headphones, and even then I've found it to be just fine. The display's color is great, and the highest brightness is very bright, while the lowest is very low, giving you a wide range of brightness, which is useful if you're around others and don't want to disturb them. All in all, for the price, this is an absolute s t e a l. I'd probably buy this over any other laptop $1,400 and down. (It also helps that I'm a sucker for the slick black and red color scheme.) The only thing I'd like is for there to be a version with a larger display, but that's really nothing to do with this model. I highly recommend this to anyone.",1,0,3,2,2

I concur with all the praise: Superb screen, fast and smooth as long as you understand the limitations of the processor, great keyboard, beautiful finish. Android apps are good enough for now and Outlook which I use all the time is incredible, so Google is slowly moving in the right direction and will only get better - patience is the key.The speakers are VERY TINNY and weak. I have low expectations for a laptop but this machine gets the prize for low end. But I can live with them considering all the other high points.Where I (for now) give it the 2 stars is a glaring problem with the trackpad that others are begining to share online: Inconsistency with click and select and click and drag. I do A LOT of text editing on my CB so this is an essential function and works like a charm on my Acer C720.Is this just a temporary bug that will get fixed shortly or is it a hardware issue? I don't know as the product is still so new.Problem for me is that this is a feature that I use so much, that having it ""broken"" makes the machine basically unusable so unless I see a fix coming up in the next few days, will have to return it. Like I said, I see others talking about the same problem so not an isolated problem to my machine.

2183,"In many ways I really like this computer, but the terrible battery life and other issues bump it down to a three star product.So what do I love about it? It's super light, set-up was a snap, screen resolution is great, the flip function (tablet mode) works overall very well with the hinge being easy to maneuver, but tight enough to hold the angle you want. The touch screen works well, the keyboard feels great. I am not a huge windows fan, but I can't bump down the rating due to that.Now here are the things that I don't love: The speakers are on the underside of the computer. To me, this makes the audio sound a little odd, especially when it's in tablet mode. When in tablet mode, the main volume control is on the back flip, so that can be a little awkward. I also don't love that the power switch is right next to the volume control switch. I know they tend to be placed next to each other, and I really don't understand why since you will undoubtedly accidentally hit the power when aiming for the volume. Another weird design issue is when you put it in tablet mode the ""DELL"" logo is upside-down. I don't care that it's upside-down, but it was just a funny design flaw that we noticed. Most importantly, the battery life is bad, especially if you are watching videos. It does charge pretty fast though, but I often find myself having to plug it in to watch a video. Another thing I noticed is that it can get very hot, which I recognized when it was in laptop mode and it was sitting on my lap. It has gotten so hot that it was quite uncomfortable and I had to move it off or lift it up for a while. When it does heat up, the fan will turn on, and it's pretty loud. The fan also turns on way more than any other computer I've ever had. It mostly seems to turn on when watching videos.To recap, I love the flip function, touch screen and how lightweight it is. I don't love the terrible battery life, some bad design issues and tendency to run hot.",1,2,3,2,4

I've seen people complain about the note taking that comes built in for the pen, just download Squid and make it default and it operates much better, then what comes pre default.

2190,"Ive been waiting for this version (the UX430-DH74) since its updated with intels 8th gen low-power cores, which for the first time are quad rather than dual core. So it was definitely worth waiting a couple of months for that.Overall, this is a great laptop  I love it. The 14 screen is beautiful, with plenty of brightness, and its matte which is my preference. Its not touch-enabled, which might be a dealbreaker for some, but I dont see the point in touch screens on laptops anyway, and I detest their glossy reflections. It does use PWM to modify brightness however; which shouldn't affect the majority of users but some might get eyestrain or headaches. It doesn't affect me personally so it's fine, and a lot of modern screens use PWM so it can be difficult to avoid.Overall, build quality is pretty good. There is a tiny flex in the metal surrounding the keypads, and again in the lid, but its negligible and barely noticeable and certainly shouldnt impact usage.Other reviews have noted the cooling performance, and yes, the fans do start up when doing cpu intensive tasks. Some people have installed Notebook Fan Control to increase the heat threshold at which the fan operates, but I havent since it doesnt really bother me  with normal usage, I certainly cant hear it over other background noises coming in from outside/my fridge. Its noticeable when it is under stress, but that tends to only be when Im doing some light gaming and Ill either have headphones in or music playing. On the whole, Id rather the fan switches on to keep the cpu cool than to have it heat up more but be quieter.The fingerprint sensor is a useful feature to have  it saves a couple of seconds logging in. Scanning accuracy isnt always great, though, and Ive added 3 different profiles of the same finger to ensure it always recognises me  ie with cold/dry finger, wet shrivelled finger from the shower and a normal one. This seems to work, though you do need to add slight pressure when using it or it doesnt recognise you.On the whole this is a great laptop, very good value for money as Asus almost always is.

Reasonable Battery Life for a laptop of this size, price rangeThere are a few cons though, but they aren't significant enough for me to lower my rating.1. No CD drive - but this is something I understand since most laptops are made without them nowadays.2. I noticed that removing/inserting anything USB-related is a bit cumbersome. The ports seem a bit too tight for accomadation3. Poor Webcam: the built-in webcam is grainy and is low quality.Thus far, everything else seems pretty good. The pros definitely outweigh the cons.

The second one seemed to work nice, for a while till the ""phantom touches"" came back but this time my laptop wasn't folded in half like the first laptop..This is very bad considering I had finals and lots of essay I couldn't write or had to wait for these spazes to stop. Really annoying. Wont be buying again.",2,4,5,4,5
2199,"Just got the little machine and the weight is great and size is very thin. Was very hopeful the experience was going to continue.Then I turned it on. As usual these vendors put on bloatware and other stuff that make it, for most novices, impossible to use. I first had to start by disabling an Intel PPT Re-certification process that was consistently taking up 40-80% of the CPU. Still need to look into how to properly turn this off because it starts up on reboot via some service. Updates for Win10 Build 1709 were not coming down either (though most likely a Windows issue). In the end I had to rebuild the machine with Win10 1709 I have available on USB.I shudder to think what a novice would do with this machine. One nice little app though... Acer Care Center allowed me to easily backup the factory build and drivers.",3,4,5,4,3

But upon first use I noticed that it was dead on arrival, which is odd in my opinion, especially if it was ""certified refurbished"" and checked prior to shipment. I thought it may just be a random glitch and overlooked it. The slow speed I could not over look then the snow screen became more regular...after not even a week of having it in my possession.

I wish that it charged like my Asus Chromebook: with USB Type-C; but I would guess it's because it uses more power than the connection can supply. Right out of the box I had an application for it: I installed Kodi with my Plex Add-on, then connected it to my TV Via HDMI and I was running home movies via my Plex server in less than 20 minutes.Like with any OEM laptop, there is some bloatware to it. I uninstalled most of it. The year subscription to McAfee is a joke: go with Comodo if you want a quality security application.",1,2,1,2,3

2217,"Slow, and I mean SLOW out of the box. It took forever just to set up the computer, and when I did the computer acted like it was 5 years old with a full hard drive. It took forever to open up any program, froze when I tried to search for a program, took minutes to shut down and restart, etc. After a google search this is apparently common for this specific Lenovo computer. I was about ready to return it, but I have a basic reset a try. That didn't work (still slow clunky), so in one final attempt I did a full reset and with a deep erase of all data on the computer, and that finally worked! It seems to be acting fine for the most part now.This computer really deserves one stall as there is no reason it should have worked that way out of the box and passed any sort of QC, but its saving grace is that with a lot of work to get it set up correctly it is actually a decent computer with great specs.

2222,Very light. Battery life is far off what they claim it to be. I had it set at 40% and was streaming about 5 1/2 hours over 2 days and it was down to 10%. Ordering a replacement and trying another. I'll leave an update.,3,2,3,2,2
2223,"On the fence about purchasing this laptop? Please continue reading:I was eyeing this laptop for several weeks now. I was hoping to get a good Black Friday or holiday deal on this item but that time never came so I bit the bullet and got it for $199 (which is reasonable).At first glance, this is quite a small laptop. Ive used 11.6 laptops before but with the thinness and weight, I was somewhat surprised by the size and worried that the keyboard would be hard to type on. It did take about two hours of consistent typing for me to get used to this thing. I type a lot of research papers and this is one of the more responsive keyboard laptops Ive used. Of course, not macbook quality but definitely better than the other budget laptops on the market. Compared to my 13.3 ASUS chromebook, the keys on this model are more cramped together and smaller in size. However, it is surprisingly nicer to type on and isnt mushy like the former.As far as battery life goes, I started at 100% estimated usage time of 12hrs. I did a full update, streamed 30mins of video, played 2hrs of pandora, downloaded a bunch of apps and installed google chrome. After all of that, and approximately 3hours later, I still have 62% battery left. I imagine that it will live up to the advertised battery life with normal use. At most, the laptop has gotten slightly warm, not enough to bother anyone should you choose to to use it on your lap though.Memory and performance. OK, this is largely the reason why I was wary of purchasing this laptop. It comes with minimal storage. After all the updates, I was left with 16gb of SSD. I did purchase a 64gb micro sd card for this laptop and all it took was changing storage preferences to get everything directed to the SD card. I did experience some trouble at first as the storage settings did not save for some reason and I had to redirect everything to the micro SD twice. It appears to be working properly now though and apps download relatively fast on this thing. I currently have 16 tabs open on Google Chrome (yes, I am that person) and everything is still running smoothly. The only lag that Ive experienced was using the Edge on this machine. Do NOT use edge! Just download google chrome and save yourself the trouble.Display and Build quality: Again, this is a very thin and lightweight laptop made out of entirely plastic, so it feels somewhat cheap. But I think the design and aesthetics may make up for that. At a glance, it looks like its made out of aluminum. I wont go into what color it is, as it varies depending on the lighting. But it appears to be a more expensive product than it really is. The screen itself is actually pretty nice for the price. Its not going to stream HD videos well but its definitely not an eyesore either. Another thing I should point out is that the black bezel on the screen is indeed plastic. (For some reason I thought it was going to be glass.) As far as ports go, all of them are in working order. I did have trouble with the USB 2.0 port as it was rather snug which made inputting and removing USBs rather difficult and with excessive force, unfortunately. Im not sure if this will be a long term issue or if it will fail on me in the long run but Im optimistic.Overall, this is a nice inexpensive laptop that will exceed expectations for anyone simply needing a laptop for essay-typing, web-browsing, and light weight tasks. It is extremely portable and is a great option for people looking to travel with a laptop. For the price and performance, it's worth it.",3,1,5,4,3
2224,"Screen already busted within its first month, don't feel like distributing it back to a repairer. Have to keep it for now. Not satisfied, very disappointed with this product.",3,3,5,5,6
2225,"I purchased this laptop last night from best buy, It was on sale for 309$ At this price point you can get a laptop that is touch screen but lacks good battery life or performance, You can get a laptop with bad performance and decent battery life or you can get this. Considering the price point this laptop is quit powerful. Overall the speakers don't sound terrible but they are down firing and don't get super loud, the display isn't the brightest but it is definitely not dim by any means. The colors on the display are not the best but certainly okay for the price point. when folded open the screen doesn't wobble around and overall the build quality is nice. AGAIN considering the price point. The keyboard definitely isn't the worst I've used. Overall I would recommend this laptop if you're a college student like me or if you are wanting a bigger laptop and on a budget. Overall the laptop doesn't get crazy loud under load. IF BATTERY LIFE IS A MAJOR CONCERN this might be an issue for you. While listening to music with the volume around 75% surfing the web this laptop only lasted around 3.5 hrs, battery saver is turned on about 85%. Battery life isn't a major concern for me because im usually around an outlet. overall this laptop is worth the price considering the pros and cons. the biggest con is the battery life.",1,4,1,3,2

2242,"I ordered my model from Best Buy, as I will start university and wanted a reliable, convenient, and dependable laptop for college years.And I love this thing, it's light, powerful, and with the large update and upgrade to Windows 10 Pro I haven't had a problem with this computer. I purchased the Surface Dock for this which truly transforms it to a desktop computer you can rely on, so this will come in handy when I come to work at home and could use the extra ports and power.The battery is great however the 14 hours part is misleading! After lightly browsing Fire Fox, upgrading to Windows 10 Pro, and setting the option to best battery life, low brightness, etc. The battery only lasted about 5 hours before getting to 30%. I notice depending on what you are doing, battery performance will vary greatly, form streaming, running programs, having multiple browsers up, etc. But the battery still is great.This laptop has an excellent design, this is by far the best touch screen I've used on any computer, which will come handy if I ever need to draw quick notes in the future.CONS:-Other colors not available for the more powerful models-Screen wobbles when you touch the screen, so if that will bother you look to getting the Surface Pro-Price. It's rather common sense to not get 4 GB in 2017 if you're spending 1000+ on a laptop, so be prepared to cough up a to of cash for this. I myself spent 1500+ dollars at Best Buy with a 10% discount... I am not rich, I had to save money all summer, but it was worth it.-You won't be able to upgrade parts on this laptop or do home repairs, so MAKE SURE you get the specs that will last through four years (I assume most getting this laptop are fellow college students such as myself) and consider you may one day have to send this in for repairs. However the superior build quality makes me feel comfortable that the only way this could break is if it were my fault or I was really unlucky/careless.-No USB-C-Mini-USB, but no HDMI or USB-c...? Really Microsoft? I've always loved and used your products but come on. If you're gonna make us use all the extra dongles, at least include them!-One USB slot, NO memory card slots!Other than that, make sure to watch reviews from various trusted YouTube Channels such as from Dave Lee and Linus Tech Tips to make sure this is the Laptop you need and want!",0,2,3,2,4

The fan runs a little loud, but generally with good headphones you can drown it out during gaming sessions.The IPS panel is also really comfortable to watch with a subtle matte finish and decent color gamut. The Chassis is aluminium and although the laptop is quite heavy, it feels extremely well built and durable. It also comes with a nice back-lit red keyboard, thunderbolt and both a 128GB SSD and a 1 TB HDD. The keyboard is quite comfy for typing, but the keystrokes seem a little short for long typing sessions (at least my preference anyway).For any serious, or recreational gamer with a taste for high quality games, this laptop will perform really well especially if you're on a budget!

As far as the hard drive space goes, that is easily resolved with the addition of an external SD card to provide more space. So from a performance standpoint I would recommend this laptop.My cons are with Microsoft (big surprise, huh?). The 14"" model comes with Windows 10 S, which is Microsoft's ""Big Brother"" version of the operating system that does not allow you to load any third party applications (i.e. - Google Chrome) that are not sanctioned by the Microsoft store. No problem, it comes with a free upgrade to Win10 Pro which allows you to load apps. So I performed the upgrade. After the upgrade and verification it was running Win10 Pro I still could not load apps because Device Guard was still active. So I followed the directions online from Microsoft to disable Device Guard then rebooted the laptop. IT BRICKED THE OPERATING SYSTEM!!! (NOTE: Not 100% sure if this was because of the changes I made or one of the KB updates that does not play well with AMD processors). So, after 2 hours of resetting the OS I'm finally running Win 10 Pro and I am able to load apps. So, buy this if you are happy just running MS authorized applications, or if you want to fight with Microsoft over the right to load any third party software, and spend hours trying to upgrade and make changes to group policy and installed MS components. Lastly, the laptop did not come with Office loaded. When I clicked on the ""Get Office"" link off the start menu it returns an error message that a specific DLL was not found and to re-install the application (re-install and application that was not installed in the first place???). Then after the reset I clicked on the link and it took me to the MS site to BUY OFFICE365!! I'm still fighting with this one.",3,1,5,4,3

I have always had Dell PCs. Rarely have I had any problems with them. Dell is usually pretty good at helping customers resolve any PC issues.The bottom line is that I am very happy with this laptop.",2,2,1,3,2
2281,"I've been using this computer for five days now... it's great! I use it for purchases, email and surfing and I couldn't be more pleased. I chose wisely. Best computer at this price range and better than computers I've purchased at triple the price. I'll update if any problems arise in the future.",3,4,5,4,3
2282,"For the money, I'm satisfied w/ my purchase. I bought it to be used as a remote work PC for software development (.NET apps) and for occasional gaming.Screen: Colors and black levels are great. Its max brightness is probably too dim for the laptop to be used outdoors, if that's important to you.Keyboard: Nice to type on. I still prefer ""full keyboard"" laptops like Alienware and old Dell laptops, but I can type quickly on this and it's comfortable enough.Heat: It's pretty much always warm, regardless of what you're doing. The upside is that's true when gaming; it doesn't get extremely hot.Weight: It doesn't feel heavy in my lap and it's well balanced. It's very easy to open and close the screen one-handed. Good build quality.Battery: OK. So long as the 1050ti GPU is off, it seems to have a ~4hour battery (of actual use). Since this is a gaming PC, I feel that's decent.Performance: Witcher 3 runs at 55-60fps consistently w/ 1600x900 and high graphics (hair works off) and looks GREAT! Titanfall 2 ""feels"" like it runs @ 60fps with 1080p and high graphics, but I haven't ran it with FRAPS to be sure. Overwatch is an unwavering 60fps at high settings.Regarding upgrades: There is an extra hard-drive access panel and an access panel for (I assume) RAM. I opened the hard-drive panel, saw there was a cable and mounting hardware for an extra drive, so I connected a 256gb SSD I had from a prior laptop. I restarted the laptop, windows 10 detected the drive, and I was able to format it in seconds. I'll probably add a second 8gb stick of ram as a future upgrade.",2,0,3,2,2
2283,I don't know what made me think this computer would be useful. It's light weight and pretty but had a hard drive smaller then my phone. Useless!,2,4,5,4,3
2284,Once d laptop is shot down the correct way it updates itself =no worries so 2thumbs up,3,1,5,4,3
2285,"Very disappointed. Came in with great portability and battery life and good stats for its price. Unfortunately, after about 6 months, it has been crashing continuously. Additionally, it has been having difficulty finding WiFi networks for a while now.",3,1,5,4,3
2286,"Excellent laptop, this is my fourth ACER I've purchased and I'm pleased with their products. Windows 10 is awful though.",2,4,1,2,2
2287,Lightweight for the size. Good value for the money. It was a replacement for an older hp.,3,1,2,4,2
2288,Just what I was looking for. I was pleasantly surprised.,3,1,5,4,3
2289,"We had lots of problems with this laptop, it kept freezing up so we had to take the battery out to re set it. It just never worked well so we ended up sending it back.",2,2,1,3,2
2290,"I spent a good amount of time searching for a decent laptop. I was stuck between a Mac and an ASUS, I ended up going with this laptop...obviously.I was looking for a laptop with a lot of memory, I'm becoming a coder so I needed plenty of space for my applications and programs. This laptop has it's pros and cons, just like anything else does. I'll start with pros: the look of it is very nice and sleek I must say, space, of course, is a big plus to me, I really just love ASUS as a whole honestly. Cons: the battery life isn't as spectacular as I would think it would be, the speakers are not that great, although I stream it through my tv so that doesn't really matter too much. Sometimes, it will randomly freeze, not too long but long enough.Overall I will say it's a good computer and I'm pleased with it. So depending on what you are looking for in terms of use, I would suggest this one if it would suit your needs.",2,2,1,2,2
2291,Graphics arent good for a gaming laptop. Looks cool tho!,2,0,3,2,2
2292,"I am in the process of returning my purchase due to constant irritating running noise, not sure if it's the hard drive or the cooling fan, but it's extremely annoying, especially if you like to work in a very quiet environment. Also runs very slow. Not at all happy with it! Can't figure out why the manufacturer would even let this off the production line without solving or correcting this issue.",3,2,1,4,2
2293,"Its so lightweight! Ive had it for about two months. Dont love the mouse/trackpad at all, but thats easily solved by using a plug in.",2,2,1,2,2
2294,This is my third chromebook. I did a lot of research before buying this one & I am very pleased with it. I don't use the touch screen or flip the screen like I thought I would though. It runs perfectly though & holds a battery for a long time. I would definitely recommend this computer.,2,4,5,4,5
2295,"Amazing Product, best laptop I've ever had. Fast and most of the recent games from 2016-2017 run on max/high settings.",1,0,1,2,1
2296,"I bought a referbed one from another site and have been using for over a month now... holy cow it is awesome. Best laptop Ive ever used hands down. Plays Wow, Fortnite no problems at all. Liked it enough I bought this brand new one for full price for my wife. She hasnt had a chance to use it but I can assume its obviosuly just as good. 100% recommend",2,0,1,0,2
2297,Better than the Macbook Pro that died after 2 weeks and was $1000 more expensive. Much faster too.,2,4,5,4,5
2298,Very happy with it so far. It may be the best $200 laptop available.,3,1,5,4,3
2299,Just turn on my new asus laptop looking good so far update fast with Cortana help pretty much doing the job no complains yet I hope so I will give 4 stars for now when I look into it more today and everyThing is as expected then Ill rate 5 stars,3,2,2,4,2
2300,"A great laptop. The weight is a killer spec. Only 1.6 kilogram which is 1.5 times less then my previous 15"" laptop. The screen is ok (better then my previous laptop but not as good as my desktop). SSD+HDD combo is good if you need both speed and storage. I initially thought that just SSD would be a better option so it would be a little bit lighter and spent less power (but would have less storage). Battery is disappointing a little bit (it is not a long lasting one. I initially thought it would be enough for a day, but it is actually for 3-5 hours of work).I like the keyboard and touchpad. As well as fingerprint which allows to log in quickly.Overall great product.",2,2,1,2,2
2301,This is one of the worst computers I have ever had. I bought it 7 months ago and there is some software issue with it that makes it randomly not connect to wifi. When I called for technical support they said it would cost me $100 to check and see if they could fix it or I could buy a manufacturer warranty that cost the same as the stupid computer. Don't waste your time or money,3,1,5,4,3
2302,This machine is well worth the money. All new systems need to update as features and securities have evolved since the software was loaded. How quickly this is done depends entirely on your internet connection speed. I am very happy I bought this laptop and highly recommend it.,3,2,1,4,2
2303,Son says it's great,2,2,0,2,2
2304,"With an SSD installed it's been running very fast. It has good battery life (not great), and a nice keyboard. The screen is of lesser quality compared to the rest of the hardware and will make you want to adjust the angle a few times in one sitting. I have had a couple of blue screens out of nowhere that my previous PC (Dell) did not have. Maybe with a driver update that will get fixed. Also probably driver related is the occasional inability for Chrome to use the default microphone/headset for things like Hangouts. Again, my previous PC did not have this problem.",2,2,1,2,2
2305,"I have never written a review before, but I feel compelled to since I just completed my return. Like many customers, I purchased this product for it's extremely reasonable price. It was a gift for my wife so that she could use it for school. The box comes and as I go through the set up process, I am unable to connect to my wireless network. After multiple attempts and a call to ASUS customer support, it turns out that this is a hardware issue. I have never purchased any technology that didn't work out of the box. I have zero faith that if I was to receive a new laptop it would come without issue. This will be the last time that I buy an electronic device primarily based on it's price. Anyone considering this laptop should invest a little more money for better quality.",3,1,5,4,3
2306,"Everyone saying the display is horrible, it is not that bad. The screen works for my uses (Work/School), I am not a graphics designer or anything.I did add patriot viper memory upping it to 32 GB. I would have been fine with 16GB.Used for 2 months now.",1,0,1,2,2
2307,does not have vga adapter for external monitor,2,2,3,2,2
2308,So far working well. I have been using it for about a month. I was not going to pay for a new one. This refurbished Latitude has exceeded my expectations. The battery is long lasting. The charger is genuine Dell.,2,4,3,2,5
2309,Very good laptop,2,0,1,2,1
2310,"Horrible, took 6 and a half hours for it to be ready to get started. Kept on updating for hours on end and makes noises. Horrible purchase, not worth getting at all.",3,2,1,4,2
2311,"On the recent recommendation of Consumer Reports, I bought one of these for travel. For $22 I added a 64Gb MicroSD card https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B010Q588D4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00, and thanks to my buddy's brilliant suggestion, I ordered this https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JUHDYSO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00 bluetooth mouse.I've used it now for several months, with a month in the Bahamas where it was my primary computer. I do a lot of typing, so something like this (no touchscreen) makes more sense for me than a big pad, and the price is sure right at $200. There is about 10-11 Gb of space left for programs, so you will need an SD chip if you plan to put much of anything on this computer. And each time Windows does any major updates, you will need to delete the files for the previous version (easily done by adding this as a category to the disc cleanup app). I found this out when I got a message that I was getting low on disc space. Deleting these files took me from 3 to 10 Gb of disc space.Because of the electronic drive, the speed seems very similar to my old Dell 32-Bit desktop, which admittedly is not real fast. But it's way faster than my iPad mini. The touch pad is actually pretty good, and the keyboard is surprisingly good. It's just got a very good feel - just the right amount of resistance and feedback.Run time is about 10 hours. Besides the MicroSD slot, it has two USB ports and an HDMI port. The 1366x768 pixel display is surprisingly good, although it does need to be at the right angle, as is the case with most laptops I've used. The default screen brightness is toned down when it's being used on the battery, but I changed that to run at 100%, and the run time is still very good.This seems like the perfect little computer, not just for travel, but also for someone who does everything on his/her phone and pad - needing a real computer only once in awhile. I was briefly tempted by the 14"" version, which is about the same price, but the 12"" version is significantly lighter, and it fits easily in my under-the-seat travel bag.As I noted, this computer has been my go to link to the world while I've been on an extended vacation in the Bahamas, and it's been great. A very big thumbs up for a light, cheap, simple, and effective laptop.",3,1,5,4,3
2312,Good computer for the price,2,2,5,4,2
2313,I owned a 5 year old laptop that was a hassle to carry around campus. It lost half its charge upon starting up when I had charged it up completely the night before. This cinder block laptop took up all the space on my desk. I needed a low-cost efficient laptop that could hold a charge and do every basic need for a college student. This was the answer! I am grateful of my purchase!,3,1,5,4,3
2314,"I didn't order my chromebook plus through Amazon, I got it from Best Buy. I purchased this chromebook mainly to annotate PDFs for coursework as a substitute for printing hundreds of pages per semester, which would ultimately end up in the garbage or storage along with all of my notes. This chromebook is extremely practical for this usage. The stylus is precise and works well to annotate with numerous programs that are smoothly integrated with google drive, making for easy document importation. There was a three year gap from the last time I used a chromebook and my purchase of this one, and the improvements to the chrome OS are amazing. There is a huge increase in functionality offline due to its capability to run programs from the playstore (including all the microsoft office programs if you're not big on google's rendition). It's basically as useful as a computer with a ""real"" operating system. I had originally intended to use it alongside my macbook air, but I have found that I've been using my air less and less. There are a few things that I don't love though. The battery life could be better, and I wish I had realized that it's USB ports are USB type C. In terms of software, it randomly crashes sometimes. I think that when the RAM is overloaded instead of just slowing down to a crawl like your average computer, it crashes and closes everything. Not a huge problem, since it's constantly automatically saving whatever you're working on but it's annoying.",2,4,5,4,5
2315,"Terrible product. Stopped working after a month and a half. The laptop was dead, would not turn on. Was under warranty, so sent it to Acer, but they said its not fixable. I will have to buy a new one and pay the regular price. Terrible product and terrible customer service.",3,4,5,4,3
2316,"I bought this for myself as a graduation present as a replacement for my Macbook, which still works BUT has slowed down considerably over the years. My first impressions were great; the thing is light, quick, aesthetically pleasing. I feel like I am just now really figuring out all the cool stuff it can do. My favorite apps so far are Painter (an app that works SEAMLESSLY with the stylus), Polytopia (so fun and addicting, very similar to Civilization but cuter), and Squid (great note-taking app, wish I would have known about it in college).My critiques:- I wish the speakers were a LITTLE louder. I've thought about buying an external speaker but haven't gotten around to it. I am happy it connects to my Bluetooth headphones!- I really miss the ability to play PC games. If they came out with one of these that could support those games, I'd buy it in a second!- I miss my backlit keys from the Mac BUT the screen brightness is so awesome that it makes them visible in the dark.Things I love about it:- Battery life. Holy moley this thing lasts forever. The screen brightness definitely speeds up my need to charge more often but I've been really impressed with how long I'm able to use it (for stuff like paying bills and writing) without needing to plug it in. It also has a speedy recharge. Very impressive!- GOOGLE DOCS. 100x better than Word in my opinion. I just love it. I also have it on my iPhone and I love the ease of accessing documents no matter where I am!- The look and weight of it. It's stunning. I love showing it off to people! My grandma thought it was just about the coolest thing she's ever seen.",2,4,5,4,5
2317,"Pros:- Excellent expandability for memory and storage.- GTX 1050 w/ 4Mb.Cons:- no USB-CAnd now to the near fatal flaw. The TN screen is nothing short of terrible. Fortunately, replacing it is a straightforward procedure. I ended up replacing mine with this: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JMM89NC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",1,0,3,2,2

2319,"Seems like a solid laptop. Basically what I was looking for a a good price: Quad core processor, touch screen, backlit keyboard, good amount of RAM and storage for streaming media and begin entry level programming. Also Bluetooth and Windows 10 is a plus. Minor games just for fun seem to be running alright as well. All of the other laptops I compared to at this price did not have ALL of these features so I felt this was the best value.The only cons of this laptop seem to be the battery life seems a little low, roughly just over 3 hours while I am multitasking different windows and apps, but maybe I need to play more with the battery saver, and it does seem to charge pretty quickly. Also I don't like the speakers being on the front/bottom of the laptop, when the laptop is actually being used on my lap, the speakers are a little muzzled.The speakers could be a little louder, as I like to blast my music loud, and when placed on my lap or a pillow or the couch or anything not a hard surface the sound could be restricted.",3,2,1,2,2

2323,"I have not used the computer yet, so this review is strictly based upon my disappointment upon receipt of product. Although description clearly states that all relevant accessories are included, there is no power source cord included! I reached out to Amazon immediately and they offered a gift card for the cost to purchase one. However, I feel I should warn others about this scenario as it appears I am mot the first customer to experience this problem. After receiving the item, I read the questions asked area and see that others were just as frustrated as myself due to the lack of power source. The computer is meant to be a gift for my nephew and was requested specifically by him via Amazon link. My lesson learned... although a requested gift; READ EVERYTHING before purchase.",2,2,5,4,2

2326,"Excellent gaming laptop for the money but sacrifices had to be made to keep the cost down.Things I like:Sleek designRespectable Hardware and Performance (Quad-Core i5, GTX 1050Ti, SSD, matte IPS monitor)Relatively lightweightThe M.2 SSD in my laptop is actually NVME (by Intel). Surely not comparable to a Samsung 960/961 but still faster than SATA protocol.Easy to upgrade RAM and add additional 2.5"" sata HDD/SSD (fortunately my laptop came with the HDD kit included)Backlit keyboardUSB3.0 Type-CPrice (got it for $699+ 6% tax )Things I don't like:The monitor may be IPS but don't expect a high RGB coverage and it is quite dim.Only 2 USB3.0 ports (the other 2 are USB2.0)The Type-C port is not Thunderbolt compatible, which kind of defeats the purpose of a Type-C port...Even though the design is sleek and attractive, it is made of plastic which, honestly, feels kind of flimsy. The finish is indeed nice but coming from a DELL i7559 (still plastic but far more solid), this ACER doesn't make me feel very confident...The M.2 SSD is not accessible unless you remove the whole back plate of the laptop, making the replacement/upgrade unnecessarily difficult and will void the Warranty. I consider this to be a major design flaw.Battery life nowhere near the advertised one. It seems to me that a 48Wh battery just cannot provide 7-8 hours as ACER claims. My old DELL had a 74Wh battery and I was happy with its 5-6 hours of battery life.CONCLUSION:Overall I am happy with my purchase.The performance/price ratio is probably the best out there.Just don't have irrational requirements. This is a gaming-on-a-budget laptop, it's not a Premium or a niche product.It is focused where it counts for the purpose it was made (processing power for decent 1080p gaming).It was not made for ultra portability, photo editing or showing off.But it does deserve every penny...",2,0,3,2,2
2327,This was not the laptop for me. My son suggested it for speed and processing but I needed one for work-related tasks. The red keyboard back light was irritating to my aging eyes.The space bar did not work on mine. Returned it. The company was great about the return.,1,0,1,2,1
2328,"I don't even know where to begin with this half baked product, In my opinion Samsung should have never released this product in its condition,I'm a diehard Samsung fan boi and this item thoroughly disappointed me, I should just be glad it didn't explode on me, the idea was great but the execution was a flop, Google never delivered on the software and Samsung failed on the hardware, as soon as I started using it I noticed the software and hardware issues, the screen was flickering randomly and the build quality was questionable, clearly not Galaxy grade material.",2,4,5,4,5
2329,Turned on the laptop; updated everything and suddenly started freezing... poor performance! It is not what is says in the descriptio. Laptop should have lasted at least 5 hours battery life when using HDD But unfortunately this one lasts not more than 2 hours.

2332,"First of, the laptop I received had a battery defect so I requested for a replacement the very next day I got it. I received the replacement after 2 days and I fell in love with the features especially with the price. I only use it for the basic stuff and it isn't that fast but I'm fine with it. But after 2 weeks of use, one of the hinges became misaligned rendering it unable to be closed without breaking it. I wasn't being careless or anything, I was just closing it like I usually do and I just heard a something crack all of a sudden. I am very disappointed with the quality of this one. It's hinges are supposed to be one of the strongest parts since it transforms into a tablet. I just hope I'll be able to return this and I will definitely get a more pricey one. Just waiting for asus to respond to my email.",3,2,5,4,3
2333,"This is an excellent little machine. I kept my eye on it for a while and watched the other reviews - if you're on the fence, and you're looking for an excellently light travel laptop that can run Office while you're on the road without breaking the bank, go for it. I'm impressed with the processing speed and the battery life is ridiculous - I ran all my updates/cleanup/installs of new apps and used it for about 3 hours a day for three days before it hit 20%. Keyboard and screen are decent quality for the price, and it handled all the uninstalling and Windows updating like a champ. Also, this is purely aesthetic, but in some of the other comments there were notes on the color...mine is definitely a light gold, no silver sheen. It looks classy, runs great,, and is so light I don't even know it's in my bag - perfect for long work trips. For the price and specs this is an excellent buy, and I am a happy Asus convert from the super-expensive and cheaply made HP options in this range.",3,1,5,4,3
2334,"Well first off, the screen is not great, the graphics should be the Ti version which would greatly improve performance, other then that it has a nice keyboard, decent trackpad, performance wise it could use the 1050ti variant to improve slightly for $800 it isn't too bad.",1,0,1,2,2
2335,"Bought this as a back up for my desk top, to create CAD drawings away from home and the most important thing, to run my Oculus Rift Touch I just bought. The specs are great for what I needed.

Started to do some updates and it took 3 days to get them loaded. Not Acers fault but need more options. Great buy for the money!",2,0,1,0,2
2336,Not sure about the negative comments on this computer I got this for $300.00 and I believe it is well worth the price It came with a 1tb drive and 8gb of ram ( up gradable to 16gb ) and works a treat. It runs Fallout 4 reasonable well and runs Metro 2033 on high settings just fine. No it's not a gaming beast but for 300 it's a steal. Well satisfied customer here. Very fast shipping.

2339,"Great Chromebook--small, light, runs smoothly, great screen, touch is nice to have, etc. The USB-C charging is a neat perk, especially if you have C chargers around for other things (phone, Nintendo, etc.). If you're a coder, you can do Linux stuff on it via Crouton, or Termux from the Play Store. I switch between this and a desktop, and though the desktop's always going to be faster, this processor doesn't feel painfully slow, which is surprising for an ARM chip.The Android app stuff is great, but don't confuse this for a purpose-built tablet--the flipped-back keyboard thing is awkward and it's big/heavy to hold anyway. Sometimes when you're running too much stuff and it runs out of memory, the whole thing will stall for a minute, annoyingly. Occasionally I wake it from sleep and it just reboots. Some of my earlier complaints about sound and the Android integration have been fixed in updates since I got it.I think the market for this overlaps with the one for stuff like the Surface or iPad Pro, or for tiny laptops in general if you don't need to run software written for Windows or the Mac.",2,4,5,4,5

2341,"I've had this laptop for about three months, and this is the second laptop (after the Rose Gold MacBook), that I have looked forward to using day in and day out. It is a weird feeling, being in love with your laptop. Most of us have probably own at least 6 laptops in our lifetimes, so you can understand where I'm coming from when I say most of us use our laptops in a utilitarian sort of way: We use it because we need to, and when we don't, we just put it away without any thought. If you want a big screen, or to play games, you would use your desktop. When you want something portable, you would most likely use your tablet. When you want something on the go, we have all used our smartphone as our main day-to-day gadget. So that leaves our laptop, as more of a business machine for doing something that requires typing on the go, whether it be to reply to an important email you can't just use your phone for, or to type out something on Word or Google Docs. For many of us, browsing the Net just isn't as satisfying on our small phones, even if it is some 6.2"" monster. There is something tactile, yet intangibly indescribable, about using our laptopYet, this is the first Windows laptop that makes me look forward to using it each day. The main culprit: Oh that gorgeous piece of metal and color. To be honest, if it just came in silver like its Surface Book counterpart, I would have never given it a second thought (by the way, I have that too, but its novelty has since worn off). I got the Burgundy version, which is just so unique - where else can you get a wine red laptop?? Each time I open its laptop sleeve and pull it out, I have to pause a moment to admire its chiseled look first, before propping it open and using it. Not only does it look great, it feels great too. As you run your fingers through it, you will appreciate that you have one of the most luxurious laptops ever. No that is not a hyperbole.Another thing that make it stands out: The stereo speakers underneath the keyboard is the best I have ever heard in a laptop (I am overseas right now, and my Huawei Matebook X awaits at home with its Dolby Atmos Harmon Kardon speakers, so I'll do an update soon). It is loud and immersive - it can't get too loud where it would create aural distortions, so at its peak it is just awesomely loud and clear enough. I have a keyboard protector over it, but I always take it off when I have some audio playing - yes, the sound is that good.Touchscreen laptops might be a gimmick, but having it is never a negative. It is perfect for scrolling web sites. Once you use it that way, you'll never go back to scrolling with your mouse or trackpad again.Speaking of the trackpad, it's supposed to have the Windows Precision software aspect, but it still is goofy most of the time. Scrolling, switching, zooming, etc., still isn't as good as any MacBooks.And speaking of the keyboard and keyboard cover, key travel and sponginess are excellent. However, the keys are a bit more slippery than I would like, so I definitely recommend one of those gel keyboard covers to help you type more precisely.The screen is bright and excellent - one of the best screens I have used. The resolution isn't as crisp and nice as my Surface Book and Macbook, but definitely better than most.About that whole Alcantara-layered interior - yes it is beautiful, yes it feels great (no more cold palms in the winter). Just keep it clean (no eating potato chips while using it).Finally, the i5 and 8GB of RAM are good enough to avoid any hiccups in performance of your every usage of a normal laptop. This is not for gaming or video rendering, so if you are not expecting that, then this laptop's performance will not disappoint.The bottom line is you will buy this laptop for its looks, period. There is no value for this laptop - it is targeted as a premium-level laptop, not a value-level laptop. Any other normal laptop with these specs would be about $200 less. So you just have to ask yourself if the burgundy or slate blue color, and the style of design/craftsmanship are worth it for you.",1,2,3,2,4

2345,"Update 2:Ok, so I hate writing reviews. I hate updating reviews. I hate updating updated reviews. So, the fact that I'm compelled to update this review less than a year after I both bought the item and updated it the first time should say something.I would strongly advise anyone looking for a Chromebook to look elsewhere. While I stand by my assessment that Chrome OS is more than enough OS for most people and that the OS is actually surprisingly developer friendly (I'm compiling C++ on it without issue, so the OS is definitely a capable Linux system), the hardware is utter garbage.So, as I had mentioned previously, there was a phantom tap issue that was fixed in on of the updates a long time ago. Well, recently the phantom tapping started up again. So, my first thought that it was a bug like last time and that it'd go away after a few updates. However, it did not.The issue increased in frequency as the last month has gone by. I started getting concerned. Well, it turns out the wiring to the touchscreen itself is actually damaged! Fantastic! Less than a year old and I've now had to disable the touchscreen just for the system to be usable. The singular feature I actually wanted out of this has now been rendered unusable.The issues don't stop there. Since about 6 months into this adventure, this Chromebook has had nearly daily wifi issues. Generally, after about 24-48 hours of uptime, I have to restart the Chromebook, otherwise, it'll start dropping wifi at an increasing rate. It also appears that Bluetooth has entirely failed in the Chromebook and it always throws a ""Cannot connect"" error any time you attempt to use Wifi.Like a good Chrome OS user, I thought maybe a powerwash would fix these issues. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The issues have become so unbearable that I'm having to look for something to replace this ""fantastic piece of machinery"" with.Generally bad experiences stick out the most. I don't want to say all Chromebook Pluses are garbage. It's very likely I just lucked out. However, I do advise caution when choosing between this and other Chromebooks.Update:So, after giving this little bugger another week (give or take a few days), I've got to say I'm enjoying it far more than I had been that first week. I've found that popping this bad boy into the ""Beta Branch"" actually produces significant stability improvements. Android apps no longer crash the entire OS now, but are still in a state of near inoperability. The rest of the OS, however, has become extremely stable and hasn't crashed at all since switching branches. On top of the stability, there seems to be at the very least a small improvement to performance. Be warned, though, switching to the beta branch and then switching back to the stable branch WILL erase all of your data on the Chromebook. Keep this in mind before deciding to switch which branch you're using.I definitely think it's a worth purchasing chromebook for those willing to embrace the beta branch. For those of you who aren't as tech savvy or are only looking for Android support, I would say it's still best to hold off.Original Review:I bought this Chromebook as a replacement for an old and quickly dying laptop that had a battery no longer able to hold a charge. As a mostly PHP developer, my first thought was that I didn't need too much power for what I'm doing. If I needed anything more than what the Chromebook had, I could simply remote into my desktop using Chrome Remote Desktop and I'd be golden.I've definitely made both the right and wrong choice here. So, I'm definitely correct in assuming I don't need as much power as I went for with my last laptop. This Chromebook most definitely does everything I need it to do. I can easily browse the internet in comfort, there are plenty of SSH clients for Chrome that I can use to remote into servers, Chrome Remote Desktop works what I consider shockingly well. As well, I'm loving everything about Chrome OS's UI in comparison to Windows 10.The Bad (skip this if you're wanting to know what the pros of this device are. This section is bound to change over the next few weeks/if an update fixes the issues found):You're probably now wondering ""why is this individual giving a product they clearly like a 2 out of 5 review!?"" Believe me, this is not the score I want to give it. I definitely love the device. In the week I've had it, I've had an extremely pleasant experience with it for the most part. However, there are multiple issues I've encountered that, until fixed, can't allow me to give it a score above 2 stars.To start with, opening more than 3 or 4 pages with any sort of moderate javascript (here's looking at you, countless banks that seem to think you need to load up 20MB worth of javascript every time you're loaded) will cause lag, so keep this in mind ""interweb power users"". This is ignorable in most cases and something I expected considering this little beaut is equipped with an ARM CPU. Nothing new there, ARM CPUs aren't powerhouses, they're power savers.If you get up to the 7 to 8 range, things start to slow down and they slow down substantially. Again, this is to be expected, it's an ARM CPU. The issue here is that things also start to become unstable at that point. Multiple times now the entire OS has locked up on me, requiring a hard reboot, roughly when I hit 9 pages open.I want to reiterate, I'm well aware of the limitations of ARM CPUs. I don't expect for this to perform just as well with 9 pages open as it does with 3 or 4 pages open. What I do expect, however, is for the OS to gracefully kill processes if it feels that things are getting too overloaded. This is a common task of OSes and something OSes do without issue.As someone that frequently deals with *nix systems, I'm well aware of how well Linux (what Chromium OS and thus Chrome OS use for their kernel) can perform and how well it can handle issues that might pop up during run time. I've had a web server running BSD stay up for a little over 2 years now without hiccup or issue. *nix OSes are reliable. They're stable. Even on ARM CPUs, they're able to handle even the most abusive tasks. However, Chrome OS seems incapable of handling of this.I'm not entirely sure if this is an issue with Chrome OS itself or potentially the big.LITTLE ARM package they've opted to use for this Chromebook. While big.LITTLE has been a common steeple of the ARM CPU and mobile device arena for a very long time now (many modern Android phones use big.LITTLE ARM packages) and is supported by the Linux kernel, it's always possible that there's a hardware issue occurring when Chrome OS calls for the big (the high powered CPU) cluster to activate and take on some tasks. This could be due to a defect with my particular unit (this is something I plan to contact Samsung about and, once I've talked to them, my rating may change), or an issue with the current version of Chrome OS's handling of these situations (same as before, if an update for Chrome OS is pushed out that fixes this issue, my rating may change).Another issue I've had revolves around the trackpad. While not a ""horrible"" trackpad, it's definitely inferior to pretty much any trackpad I've ever used in the past. It seems to have an issue where randomly it decides I've placed 2 fingers on it even though I've only placed 1 finger on it, causing it to switch into scrolling mode. This seems to be an on and off issue, one that I thought was potentially caused by something sitting on top of the trackpad along with my finger that registered as a finger. However, when this occurs, even wiping off the trackpad doesn't fix the issue.The Good:So, with all of the negativity out of the way, here are the things I love about this Chromebook (I bet you didn't see this coming)! First off, the keyboard is extremely enjoyable to use. I'm a huge fan of chicklet keyboards and this one really takes the cake. It's quick to type on and (because I'm relatively weird as many developers are) it makes a super delightful clicky noise as the keys are tapped. I've always been a fan of the noise keys make when being pressed anyway, but this has to be one of my favorite sounding chicklet keyboards.As well, the touch screen is an absolute godsend. Everything about it is great. It's extremely responsive and feels very natural to use while derping about on websites. The Chromebook is packaged with a fairly simple (though very awesome) drawing app that takes advantage of the screen and pen's pressure sensitivity that really shows off what could be done with this device. While I'm not really an artist, I will definitely say that this app will become a common part of my weekly routine for stress relief. Something about drawing really clears the mind.Another thing I really love is the Android/Google Play Store app compatibility (I address this further down so, if you're new to Chrome OS, please read the disclaimer further down the review). I've got quite a few apps that I use very frequently on my cellphone such as Andchat (IRC app) and Timely (alarm app). These apps work almost flawlessly in Chrome OS. Timely runs in the background as one would expect, syncing up with my phone's alarms. Andchat is just as buggy as it is on Android itself (it has some issues with crashing when losing focus if it's connecting to a server) but overall is a treat of an experience when used on this Chromebook.Finally, I can't emphasize how much I love everything about the Chrome apps. Chrome itself has been my browser of choice for years now, and seeing what people can do with apps through HTML5 and Javascript through the Javascript API the OS provides (direct file access, file system access implementations such as mounting SMB shares, Dropbox accounts, Onedrive accounts, etc) is truly amazing. There's so much potential that I'm really looking forward to Chrome OS growing.The Ugly:This is separate from the rest of the review so, if you've made it this far and you have experience with Chrome OS, you're free to go!As a warning to people that want to purchase this Chromebook purely for it's Android app support, it's clearly a very early beta and the Chromium Project (the group responsible for maintaining the open sourced Chromium OS which Chrome OS derives from) explicitly mentions this fact. Do not expect all of your favorite apps to be compatible, there's a good chance they aren't. As well, do not expect all of your apps that claim to be compatible to run correctly or at all. Many of them, especially those that use OpenGL (pretty much anything with ""pretty graphics""), can and will cause the Chromebook to lock up.This is bound to change in the future as the technology advances and improves, but if that's your only reason for wanting this Chromebook, you're far better off just getting an Android tablet.",2,4,5,4,5

2356,"My experience with the Lenovo Flex 5 started about a month ago. At a glance the laptop itself looks beautiful. It has a sleek design and a crisp screen that makes videos look as if you are actually there in person.The graphics of the computer, however, leave some room to be desired. This is not a laptop you will be playing games on as it barely scrapes by to make the requirements for Civilization 5, never-mind any newer games.There are a few features that I have enjoyed in the last few weeks. First, the fingerprint sensor makes logging in fast and easy. It is very reliable and almost always recognizes my fingerprint on the first try. Second, the keyboard has a comfortable feel to it. The keys are crisp enough to have satisfaction when you type while not so loud that the whole neighborhood can hear you crunch the keys (as with some mechanical keyboards.)The battery life is satisfactory, but not the best I have seen in a laptop. Keep in mind that the screen in this computer is huge, and that alone can create a strain on the battery. Those people who like to go long periods of time without charging may find themselves out of luck and stuck in the abysmal battery saver mode.Focusing now on the flex part of the product, I dont see myself using the tablet version too much. One way that feature is extremely useful, though, is for reading or watching a movie. Instead of having a heavy laptop sprawled across you (and the laptop is decently heavy), one can easily hold it in a more natural position to help facilitate hours of Netflix binge watching.Overall, my experience with this laptop has been a positive one.

The next day when I turned it on it took a while before a picture came on the screen, then I clicked and got the login screen and put a pin in after which the screen went blank for 10 minutes, then switched off. I can't remember whether it came back on by itself or whether I turned it on, but there was another blank screen for 10 minutes. Then a photo came on and sat there for awhile. Eventually a few icons appeared, accompanied by a spinning blue circle that went on and on and wouldn't stop. I was never able to use the computer beyond that first time and have had to return it.

2397,I like this laptop. upgraded from a dell i3531 which is a $250 laptop so its a huge step up for me though It still a plastic laptop so you probably should expect small cracks on the side of the laptop that doesn't effect the usability and isn't noticeable. to help avoid this recommend getting a poly carbonate shell to give you laptop more protection. I like that the laptop has a full HD panel but the TN display make colors look much worse when compared to IPS but its overall is fine if you never used an IPS screen (the difference is considerable). Sound is good and the underside sub woofer makes listening to music a lot more immersive. 3 USB 3.0 ports isn't enough for me i need at least 4 since one port is always occupied with a wireless mouse receiver i also need a port to charge my mouse and a port for a external HDD which means i always need to unplug one of these things if want to use another USB. The HDD version i have is way too slow for 2018 standards and i think SSD's are close to becoming the standard for laptops. Keyboard and track pad are good so no worries unless your not used having a NumPad to the right of the keyboard which requires you to slightly disposition your hands from the center of the laptop to the left which is slightly uncomfortable if you want to type papers. I usually keep my laptop on my desk since I've seen pictures of the 7559 (which has the same body as this laptop) being completely destroyed because of the hinge defect on these laptops. At first i was worried that this might happen to me but its been over 2 months since i bought this so my fears have settled but you should still be careful to not drop this laptop cause it will probably break unless you get the poly carbonate shell which will make this laptop stronger. the gaming side of this laptop is fine and the fans do get noisy when your gaming but its drowned out by the games so i really notice most of the time.As of right now dell released the new G series gaming laptops which start at $750 which is 100 dollars more but the quality is bound to be improved and it has HDMI 2.0 for 4K at 60HZ and a M.2 SSD NVME drive for crazy fast memory speed even faster then M.2 SSD(which is the best you can get for this laptop). For example SSD M.2 is 5 times faster then HDD and NVME SSD M.2 is 5 times faster then a M.2 SSD.. though NVME M.2 SSD's are much more expensive but will get cheaper in the future so you can always buy one separately and add it in yourself since dell gaming laptops are easy to upgrade.the upgraded hardware on the G3 means your more future proof with G3 series laptops then with this 5577 but that is not to say you wont be fine with this laptop since you still able to do work on this laptop and game.Overall i gave this laptop 4 stars since its decent and i got it for $636.50 ($676.28 with tax) so i recommend getting this if you don't intend to run a 4k at 60HZ monitor or require NVME and don't care about color accuracy on the display.P.S you can run 4K at 30HZ which is enough for movies. also the polycarbonate shell I am referring to is here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XDBVZW6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1,1,0,1,2,2

Quite honestly, I regret getting it. You are literally paying a little over $900 for a computer that will die on you. I also hate that it gets dirty easily. For example, the smudges on the keyboard. The design on the mouse pad thing could have been better as well. They should have added a button or something where you can disable the mouse pad, that way it's not randomly clicking while you are typing something on the keyboard.The performance is great. I just wish that it had better design and the battery didn't die so quickly. Of course, if you want a better layout, you have to spend a little more money but tbh, again.. there are other designs out there for the same out of price or less that has the same specs and performance as this. You are literally paying for the name ""MSI:.",2,0,1,2,2

2402,"I bought it about 2-3 weeks ago and I honestly cant find any thing wrong with the laptop great build quality, great specs. maybe the battery is not that great (only 5 hours of browsing and streaming videos ) but overall great gaming experience for the price :)",1,0,5,2,2
2403,"I love this but I am disappointed with the parental control. Google removed the supervised user feature so no parental control available except for family link, which is a horrible app. My son had to create a new google account to get this app. He could not even use his old google accounts at all in this chromebook. He has to use his other google accounts for his school, but to use family link, it was not allowed.I am happy with all other features of this chromebook, but the main reason i purchased this was for my son's school work. This became useless.I don't know why Google remoeved ""the supervised user function"" which was the main reason I chose chromebook. I am going to return it.",2,4,5,4,5
2404,"I work in IT so I get to see/touch and go through a lot of Windows PC's, Chromebooks and tablets.This is, by far, the best computer of any sort, Mac or otherwise, that I have ever touched, seen, owned or used. It's just perfect in every way.The hardware design is beautiful. It has a solidness to it that feels Apple or Mercedes quality. The screen is beautiful, touch, and it's fast.Battery life is great, performance is great, the keyboard has a perfect travel distance and click for those of us that are rapid typists-- you won't be disappointed.It has ""real"" usb connectivity which is so uncommon these days. The touchpad is glass and sensitive enough that I will use it. Previously Mac was the only computer with a good enough touchpad that I was willing/able to give up a wireless mouse.I could not be more pleased with this computer, I love it to the end of the world and back.

2405,"The laptop is a good value for what it provides. But, the screen and sound though fair are a little underwhelming. My older ASUS NV53V has much brighter screen and it sounds a lot better than this one.Everything else is top notch.----Update 7/19/2017I have used this laptop for a month now. To be fair, the display and sound are both as one would expect other laptops in the price bracket. In the era of rating inflation, I will up my rating to full 5 stars.",2,2,1,2,2
2406,"I dont like it that much adnd also come with a sound problem, it make poor contact with the speaker when you move the screen and i can return because i send it to a friend outside the country, really disapointed with this product.
